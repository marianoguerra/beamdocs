edition of the specification. In the 2002 edition,
new features were introduced. The following features
of the 2002 edition are fully or partly supported:</p><ul><li> <p>Decimal notation (for example, <strong>"1.5e3</strong>) for REAL values.
The NR1, NR2, and NR3 formats as explained in ISO 6093 are
supported.</p> </li><li> <p>The <strong>RELATIVE-OID</strong> type for relative object identifiers is
fully supported.</p> </li><li> <p>The subtype constraint (<strong>CONTAINING</strong>/<strong>ENCODED BY</strong>) to
constrain the content of an octet string or a bit string is
parsed when compiling, but no further action is taken. This
constraint is not a PER-visible constraint.</p> </li><li> <p>The subtype constraint by regular expressions (<strong>PATTERN</strong>)
for character string types is parsed when compiling, but no
further action is taken. This constraint is not a
PER-visible constraint.</p> </li><li> <p>Multiple-line comments as in C, <strong>/* ... */</strong>, are
supported.</p> </li></ul><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the Erlang
programming language, concepts of OTP, and is familiar with the
ASN.1 notation. The ASN.1 notation is documented in the standard
definition X.680, which is the primary text. It can also be
helpful, but not necessary, to read the standard definitions
X.681, X.682, X.683, X.690, and X.691.</p><p>A good book explaining those reference texts is
