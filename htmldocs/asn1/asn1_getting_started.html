run the Erlang ASN.1 compiler.</p><p>Create a file named <strong>People.asn</strong> containing the following:</p><pre>
People DEFINITIONS AUTOMATIC TAGS ::=
BEGIN
  Person ::= SEQUENCE {
    name PrintableString,
    location INTEGER {home(0),field(1),roving(2)},
    age INTEGER OPTIONAL
  }
END      </pre><p>This file must be compiled before it can be used.
The ASN.1 compiler checks that the syntax is correct and that the
text represents proper ASN.1 code before generating an abstract
syntax tree. The code-generator then uses the abstract syntax
tree to generate code.</p><p>The generated Erlang files are placed in the current directory or
in the directory specified with option <strong>{outdir,Dir}</strong>.</p><p>The following shows how the compiler
can be called from the  Erlang shell:</p><pre>
1&gt;<span class="input"> asn1ct:compile("People", [ber]).</span>
ok
2&gt;      </pre><p>Option <strong>verbose</strong> can be added to get information
about the generated files:</p><pre>
2&gt;<span class="input"> asn1ct:compile("People", [ber,verbose]).</span>
Erlang ASN.1 compiling "People.asn" 
--{generated,"People.asn1db"}--
--{generated,"People.hrl"}--
--{generated,"People.erl"}--
ok
3&gt;      </pre><p>ASN.1 module <strong>People</strong> is now accepted and the
abstract syntax tree is saved in file <strong>People.asn1db</strong>.
The generated Erlang code is compiled using the Erlang compiler
and loaded into the Erlang runtime system. There is now an API
for <strong>encode/2</strong> and <strong>decode/2</strong> in module
<strong>People</strong>, which is called like:<br/>
<strong>'People':encode(&lt;Type name&gt;, &lt;Value&gt;)</strong>
<br/>
or<br/>
<strong>'People':decode(&lt;Type name&gt;, &lt;Value&gt;)</strong></p><p>Assume that there is a network
application that receives instances of the ASN.1 defined
type <strong>Person</strong>, modifies, and sends them back again:</p><pre><code class="">
receive
   {Port,{data,Bytes}} -&gt;
       case 'People':decode('Person',Bytes) of
           {ok,P} -&gt;
               {ok,Answer} = 'People':encode('Person',mk_answer(P)),
               Port ! {self(),{command,Answer}};
           {error,Reason} -&gt;
               exit({error,Reason})
       end
    end,      </code></pre><p>In this example, a series of bytes is received from an
external source and the bytes are then decoded into a valid
Erlang term. This was achieved with the call
<strong>'People':decode('Person',Bytes)</strong>, which returned
an Erlang value of the ASN.1 type <strong>Person</strong>. Then an answer was
constructed  and encoded using
<strong>'People':encode('Person',Answer)</strong>, which takes an
instance of a defined ASN.1 type and transforms it to a
binary according to the BER or PER encoding rules.</p><p>The encoder and decoder can also be run from the shell:</p><pre>
2&gt; <span class="input">Rockstar = {'Person',"Some Name",roving,50}.</span>
{'Person',"Some Name",roving,50}
3&gt; <span class="input">{ok,Bin} = 'People':encode('Person',Rockstar).</span>
{ok,&lt;&lt;243,17,19,9,83,111,109,101,32,78,97,109,101,2,1,2,
      2,1,50&gt;&gt;}
4&gt; <span class="input">{ok,Person} = 'People':decode('Person',Bin).</span>
{ok,{'Person',"Some Name",roving,50}}
5&gt;      </pre><h2>Module Dependencies</h2><p>It is common that ASN.1 modules import defined types, values, and
other entities from another ASN.1 module.</p><p>Earlier versions of the ASN.1 compiler required that modules
that were imported from had to be compiled before the module
that imported. This caused problems when ASN.1 modules had circular
dependencies.</p><p>Referenced modules are now parsed when the compiler finds an
entity that is imported. No code is generated for
the referenced module. However, the compiled modules rely on
that the referenced modules are also compiled.</p><h2>ASN.1 Application User Interface</h2><p>The <strong>ASN.1</strong> application provides the following two
separate user interfaces:</p><ul><li> <p>The module <strong>asn1ct</strong>, which provides the compile-time functions
(including the compiler)</p> </li><li> <p>The module <strong>asn1rt_nif</strong>, which provides the runtime functions
for the ASN.1 decoder for the BER back end</p> </li></ul><p>The reason for this division of the interfaces into compile-time
and runtime
is that only runtime modules (<strong>asn1rt*</strong>) need to be loaded in
an embedded system. 
</p><h2>Compile-Time Functions</h2><p>The ASN.1 compiler can be started directly from the command line
by the <strong>erlc</strong> program. This is convenient when compiling
many ASN.1 files from the command line or when using Makefiles.
Some examples of how the <strong>erlc</strong> command can be used to start
the ASN.1 compiler:</p><pre>
erlc Person.asn
erlc -bper Person.asn
erlc -bber ../Example.asn
erlc -o ../asnfiles -I ../asnfiles -I /usr/local/standards/asn1 Person.asn</pre><p>Useful options for the ASN.1 compiler:</p><dl><dt><strong>-b[ber | per | uper]</strong></dt><dd> <p>Choice of encoding rules. If omitted, <strong>ber</strong> is the
default.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-o OutDirectory</strong></dt><dd> <p>Where to put the generated files. Default is the current
directory.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-I IncludeDir</strong></dt><dd> <p>Where to search for <strong>.asn1db</strong> files and ASN.1
source specs to resolve references to other
modules. This option can be repeated many times if there
are several places to search in. The compiler
searches the current directory first.</p> </dd><dt><strong>+der</strong></dt><dd> <p>DER encoding rule. Only when using option <strong>-ber</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>+maps</strong></dt><dd> <p>Use maps instead of records to represent the <strong>SEQUENCE</strong> and
<strong>SET</strong> types. No <strong>.hrl</strong> files will be generated.
See the Section <a href="./asn1_getting_started#MAP_SEQ_SET"> Map representation for SEQUENCE and SET</a>
for more information.</p> </dd><dt><strong>+asn1config</strong></dt><dd> <p>This functionality works together with option
<strong>ber</strong>. It enables the specialized decodes, see Section
<a href="asn1_spec">Specialized Decode</a>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>+undec_rest</strong></dt><dd> <p>A buffer that holds a message being decoded can also have
trailing bytes. If those trailing bytes are important, they
can be returned along with the decoded value by compiling
the ASN.1 specification with option <strong>+undec_rest</strong>.
The return value from the decoder is
<strong>{ok,Value,Rest}</strong> where <strong>Rest</strong> is a binary
containing the trailing bytes.</p> </dd><dt><strong>+'Any Erlc Option'</strong></dt><dd> <p>Any option can be added to the Erlang compiler when
compiling the generated Erlang files. Any option
unrecognized by the ASN.1 compiler is passed to the
Erlang compiler.</p> </dd></dl><p>For a complete description of <strong>erlc</strong>, see
ERTS Reference Manual.</p><p>The compiler and other compile-time functions can also be started
from the Erlang shell. Here follows a brief
description of the primary functions. For a
complete description of each function, see module <strong>asn1ct</strong> in
the <a href="asn1ct">ASN.1 Reference Manual</a>.</p><p>The compiler is started by <strong>asn1ct:compile/1</strong> with
default options, or <strong>asn1ct:compile/2</strong> if explicit options
are given.</p><p>Example:</p><pre>
asn1ct:compile("H323-MESSAGES.asn1").      </pre><p>This equals:</p><pre>
asn1ct:compile("H323-MESSAGES.asn1",[ber]).      </pre><p>If PER encoding is wanted:</p><pre>
asn1ct:compile("H323-MESSAGES.asn1",[per]).      </pre><p>The generic encode and decode functions can be called
as follows:</p><pre>
'H323-MESSAGES':encode('SomeChoiceType',{call,&lt;&lt;"octetstring"&gt;&gt;}).
'H323-MESSAGES':decode('SomeChoiceType',Bytes).      </pre><h2>Runtime Functions</h2><p>When an ASN.1 specification is compiled with option <strong>ber</strong>,
the <strong>asn1rt_nif</strong> module and the NIF library in
<strong>asn1/priv_dir</strong> are needed at runtime.</p><p>By calling function <strong>info/0</strong> in a generated module, you
get information about which compiler options were used.</p><h2>Errors</h2><p>Errors detected at
compile-time are displayed on the screen together with line
numbers indicating where in the source file the respective error
was detected. If no errors are found, an Erlang ASN.1 module is
created.</p><p>The runtime encoders and decoders execute within a catch and
return <strong>{ok, Data}</strong> or
<strong>{error, {asn1, Description}}</strong> where
<strong>Description</strong> is
an Erlang term describing the error.</p><p>Currently, <strong>Description</strong> looks like this:
<strong>{ErrorDescription, StackTrace}</strong>. Applications should
not depend on the exact contents of <strong>Description</strong> as it
could change in the future.</p><a name="inlineExamples"></a><h2>Multi-File Compilation</h2><p>There are various reasons for using multi-file compilation:</p><ul><li>To choose the name for the generated module, for example, because you need to compile the same specs for different encoding rules.</li><li>You want only one resulting module.</li></ul><p>Specify which ASN.1 specs to compile in a module with extension
<strong>.set.asn</strong>. Choose a module name and provide the
names of the ASN.1 specs. For example, if you have the specs
<strong>File1.asn</strong>, <strong>File2.asn</strong>, and <strong>File3.asn</strong>, your
module <strong>MyModule.set.asn</strong> looks as follows:</p><pre>
File1.asn
File2.asn
File3.asn    </pre><p>If you compile with the following, the result is one merged
module <strong>MyModule.erl</strong> with the generated code from the three
ASN.1 specs:</p><pre><code class="">
~&gt; erlc MyModule.set.asn    </code></pre><h2>Remark about Tags</h2><p>Tags used to be important for all users of ASN.1, because it
was necessary to add tags manually to certain constructs in order
for the ASN.1 specification to be valid. Example of
an old-style specification:</p><pre>
Tags DEFINITIONS ::=
BEGIN
  Afters ::= CHOICE { cheese [0] IA5String,
                      dessert [1] IA5String }
END </pre><p>Without the tags (the numbers in square brackets) the ASN.1
compiler refused to compile the file.</p><p>In 1994 the global tagging mode <strong>AUTOMATIC TAGS</strong> was introduced.
By putting <strong>AUTOMATIC TAGS</strong> in the module header, the ASN.1
compiler automatically adds tags when needed. The following is the
same specification in <strong>AUTOMATIC TAGS</strong> mode:</p><pre>
Tags DEFINITIONS AUTOMATIC TAGS ::=
BEGIN
  Afters ::= CHOICE { cheese IA5String,
                      dessert IA5String }
END </pre><p>Tags are not mentioned any more in this User's Guide.</p><a name="ASN1Types"></a><h2>ASN.1 Types</h2><p>This section describes the ASN.1 types including their
functionality, purpose, and how values are assigned in Erlang.
</p><p>ASN.1 has both primitive and constructed types:</p><table class="table table-bordered table-hover table-striped"><caption>Supported ASN.1 Types</caption><tbody><tr><td><em>Primitive Types</em></td><td><em>Constructed Types</em></td></tr><tr><td><a href="#BOOLEAN">BOOLEAN</a></td><td><a href="#SEQUENCE">SEQUENCE</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="#INTEGER">INTEGER</a></td><td><a href="#SET">SET</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="#REAL">REAL</a></td><td><a href="#CHOICE">CHOICE</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="#NULL">NULL</a></td><td><a href="#SOF">SET OF and SEQUENCE OF</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="#ENUMERATED">ENUMERATED</a></td><td><a href="#ANY">ANY</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="#BIT STRING">BIT STRING</a></td><td><a href="#ANY">ANY DEFINED BY</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="#OCTET STRING">OCTET STRING</a></td><td><a href="#NegotiationTypes">EXTERNAL</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="#Character Strings">Character Strings</a></td><td><a href="#NegotiationTypes">EMBEDDED PDV</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="#OBJECT IDENTIFIER">OBJECT IDENTIFIER</a></td><td><a href="#NegotiationTypes">CHARACTER STRING</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="#Object Descriptor">Object Descriptor</a></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><a href="#The TIME types">TIME Types</a></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><a name="TypeNameValue"></a><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>The values of each ASN.1 type have their own representation in Erlang, as
described in the following sections. Users must provide
these values for encoding according to the representation, as shown in the
following example:</p></div><pre>
Operational ::= BOOLEAN --ASN.1 definition    </pre><p>In Erlang code it can look as follows:</p><pre>
Val = true,
{ok,Bytes} = MyModule:encode('Operational', Val),    </pre><a name="BOOLEAN"></a><h2>BOOLEAN</h2><p>Booleans in ASN.1 express values that can be either
<strong>TRUE</strong> or <strong>FALSE</strong>.
The meanings assigned to <strong>TRUE</strong> and <strong>FALSE</strong> are outside the scope
of this text.</p><p>In ASN.1 it is possible to have:</p><pre>
Operational ::= BOOLEAN</pre><p>Assigning a value to type <strong>Operational</strong> in Erlang is possible by
using the following Erlang code:</p><pre><code class="erl">
Myvar1 = true,</code></pre><p>Thus, in Erlang the atoms <strong>true</strong> and <strong>false</strong> are used
to encode a boolean value.</p><a name="INTEGER"></a><h2>INTEGER</h2><p>ASN.1 itself specifies indefinitely large integers. Erlang
systems with version 4.3 and higher support very large
integers, in practice indefinitely large integers.</p><p>The concept of subtyping can be applied to integers and
to other ASN.1 types. The details of subtyping are not
explained here; for more information, see X.680. Various
syntaxes are allowed when defining a type as an integer:</p><pre>
T1 ::= INTEGER
T2 ::= INTEGER (-2..7)
T3 ::= INTEGER (0..MAX)
T4 ::= INTEGER (0&lt;..MAX)
T5 ::= INTEGER (MIN&lt;..-99)
T6 ::= INTEGER {red(0),blue(1),white(2)}</pre><p>The Erlang representation of an ASN.1 <strong>INTEGER</strong> is an integer or
an atom if a <strong>Named Number List</strong> (see <strong>T6</strong> in the previous
list) is specified.</p><p>The following is an example of Erlang code that assigns values for the
types in the previous list:</p><pre>
T1value = 0,
T2value = 6,
T6value1 = blue,
T6value2 = 0,
T6value3 = white</pre><p>These Erlang variables are now bound to valid instances of
ASN.1 defined types. This style of value can be passed directly
to the encoder for transformation into a series of bytes.</p><p>The decoder returns an atom if the value corresponds to a
symbol in the <strong>Named Number List</strong>.</p><a name="REAL"></a><h2>REAL</h2><p>The following ASN.1 type is used for real numbers:</p><pre>
R1 ::= REAL</pre><p>It is assigned a value in Erlang as follows:</p><pre>
R1value1 = "2.14",
R1value2 = {256,10,-2},</pre><p>In the last line, notice that the tuple {256,10,-2} is the real number
2.56 in a special notation, which encodes faster than simply
stating the number as <strong>"2.56"</strong>. The arity three tuple is
<strong>{Mantissa,Base,Exponent}</strong>, that is, Mantissa * Base^Exponent.</p><a name="NULL"></a><h2>NULL</h2><p>The type <strong>NULL</strong> is suitable where supply and recognition of a value
is important but the actual value is not.</p><pre>
Notype ::= NULL</pre><p>This type is assigned in Erlang as follows:</p><pre>
N1 = 'NULL',</pre><p>The actual value is the quoted atom <strong>'NULL'</strong>.</p><a name="ENUMERATED"></a><h2>ENUMERATED</h2><p>The type <strong>ENUMERATED</strong> can be used when the value you want to
describe can only take one of a set of predefined values. Example:</p><pre>
DaysOfTheWeek ::= ENUMERATED { 
    sunday(1),monday(2),tuesday(3),
    wednesday(4),thursday(5),friday(6),saturday(7) }</pre><p>For example, to assign a weekday value in Erlang, use the same atom
as in the <strong>Enumerations</strong> of the type definition:</p><pre>
Day1 = saturday,</pre><p>The enumerated type is similar to an integer type, when
defined with a set of predefined values. The difference is that
an enumerated type can only have specified
values, whereas an integer can have any value.</p><a name="BIT STRING"></a><h2>BIT STRING</h2><p>The type <strong>BIT STRING</strong> can be used to model information that
is made up of arbitrary length series of bits. It is intended
to be used for selection of flags, not for binary files.</p><p>In ASN.1, <strong>BIT STRING</strong> definitions can look as follows:</p><pre>
Bits1 ::= BIT STRING
Bits2 ::= BIT STRING {foo(0),bar(1),gnu(2),gnome(3),punk(14)}</pre><p>The following two notations are available for representation of <strong>BIT STRING</strong> values in Erlang and as input to the encode functions:</p><ul><li>A bitstring. By default, a <strong>BIT STRING</strong> with no symbolic names is decoded to an Erlang bitstring.</li><li>A list of atoms corresponding to atoms in the <strong>NamedBitList</strong> in the <strong>BIT STRING</strong> definition. A <strong>BIT STRING</strong> with symbolic names is always decoded to the format shown in the following example:</li></ul><pre>
Bits1Val1 = &lt;&lt;0:1,1:1,0:1,1:1,1:1&gt;&gt;,
Bits2Val1 = [gnu,punk],
Bits2Val2 = &lt;&lt;2#1110:4&gt;&gt;,
Bits2Val3 = [bar,gnu,gnome],</pre><p><strong>Bits2Val2</strong> and <strong>Bits2Val3</strong> denote the same value.</p><p><strong>Bits2Val1</strong> is assigned symbolic values. The assignment means
that the bits corresponding to <strong>gnu</strong> and <strong>punk</strong>, that is, bits
2 and 14 are set to 1, and the rest are set to 0. The symbolic values
are shown as a list of values. If a named value, which is not
specified in the type definition, is shown, a runtime error occurs.</p><p><strong>BIT STRING</strong>s can also be subtyped with, for example, a <strong>SIZE</strong>
specification:</p><pre>
Bits3 ::= BIT STRING (SIZE(0..31))      </pre><p>This means that no bit higher than 31 can be set.</p><h2>Deprecated Representations for BIT STRING</h2><p>In addition to the representations described earlier, the
following deprecated representations are available if the
specification has been compiled with option
<strong>legacy_erlang_types</strong>:</p><ul><li>Aa a list of binary digits (0 or 1). This format is accepted as input to the encode functions, and a <strong>BIT STRING</strong> is decoded to this format if option <em>legacy_bit_string</em> is given. </li><li>As <strong>{Unused,Binary}</strong> where <strong>Unused</strong> denotes how many trailing zero-bits 0-7 that are unused in the least significant byte in <strong>Binary</strong>. This format is accepted as input to the encode functions, and a <strong>BIT STRING</strong> is decoded to this format if <strong>compact_bit_string</strong> has been given. </li><li>As a hexadecimal number (or an integer). Avoid this as it is easy to misinterpret a <strong>BIT STRING</strong> value in this format. </li></ul><a name="OCTET STRING"></a><h2>OCTET STRING</h2><p><strong>OCTET STRING</strong> is the simplest of all ASN.1 types. <strong>OCTET STRING</strong> only moves or transfers, for example, binary files or other
unstructured information complying with two rules: the
bytes consist of octets and encoding is not required.</p><p>It is possible to have the following ASN.1 type definitions:</p><pre>
O1 ::= OCTET STRING
O2 ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE(28))      </pre><p>With the following example assignments in Erlang:</p><pre>
O1Val = &lt;&lt;17,13,19,20,0,0,255,254&gt;&gt;,
O2Val = &lt;&lt;"must be exactly 28 chars...."&gt;&gt;,</pre><p>By default, an <strong>OCTET STRING</strong> is always represented as
an Erlang binary. If the specification has been compiled with
option <strong>legacy_erlang_types</strong>, the encode functions
accept both lists and binaries, and the decode functions
decode an <strong>OCTET STRING</strong> to a list.</p><a name="Character Strings"></a><h2>Character Strings</h2><p>ASN.1 supports a wide variety of character sets. The main difference
between an <strong>OCTET STRING</strong> and a character string is that the
<strong>OCTET STRING</strong> has no imposed semantics on the bytes delivered.</p><p>However, when using, for example, IA5String (which closely
resembles ASCII), byte 65 (in decimal
notation) <em>means</em> character 'A'.
</p><p>For example, if a defined type is to be a VideotexString and
an octet is received with the unsigned integer value <strong>X</strong>,
the octet is to be interpreted as specified in standard
ITU-T T.100, T.101. 
</p><p>The  ASN.1 to Erlang compiler
does not determine the correct interpretation of each BER
string octet value with different character strings. The
application is responsible for interpretation
of octets. Therefore, from the BER
string point of view, octets are very similar to
character strings and are compiled in the same way.
</p><p>When PER is
used, there is a significant difference in the encoding scheme
between <strong>OCTET STRING</strong>s and other strings. The constraints
specified for a type are especially important for PER, where
they affect the encoding.
</p><p>Examples:</p><pre>
Digs ::= NumericString (SIZE(1..3))
TextFile ::= IA5String (SIZE(0..64000))      </pre><p>The corresponding Erlang assignments:</p><pre>
DigsVal1 = "456",
DigsVal2 = "123",
TextFileVal1 = "abc...xyz...",
TextFileVal2 = [88,76,55,44,99,121 .......... a lot of characters here ....]</pre><p>The Erlang representation for "BMPString" and
"UniversalString" is either a list of ASCII values or a list
of quadruples. The quadruple representation associates to the
Unicode standard representation of characters. The ASCII
characters are all represented by quadruples beginning with
three zeros like {0,0,0,65} for character 'A'. When
decoding a value for these strings, the result is a list of
quadruples, or integers when the value is an ASCII character.</p><p>The following example shows how it works. Assume the following
specification is in file <strong>PrimStrings.asn1</strong>:</p><pre>
PrimStrings DEFINITIONS AUTOMATIC TAGS ::=
BEGIN
   BMP ::= BMPString
END    </pre><p>Encoding and decoding some strings:</p><pre>

with an <strong>OBJECT IDENTIFIER</strong>. Assume the following example:</p><pre>
Oid ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER</pre><p>Therefore, the following example is a valid Erlang instance of
type 'Oid':</p><pre>
OidVal1 = {1,2,55},</pre><p>The <strong>OBJECT IDENTIFIER</strong> value is simply a tuple with the
consecutive values, which must be integers.
</p><p>The first value is limited to the values 0, 1, or 2. The
second value must be in the range 0..39 when the first value
is 0 or 1.
</p><p>The <strong>OBJECT IDENTIFIER</strong> is an important type and it is
widely used within different standards to identify various
objects uniquely. Dubuisson: ASN.1 - Communication Between
Heterogeneous Systems includes an
easy-to-understand description of the use of
<strong>OBJECT IDENTIFIER</strong>.</p><a name="Object Descriptor"></a><h2>Object Descriptor</h2><p>Values of this type can be assigned a value as an ordinary string
as follows:</p><pre>
      "This is the value of an Object descriptor"</pre><a name="The TIME types"></a><h2>TIME Types</h2><p>Two time types are defined within ASN.1: Generalized
Time and Universal Time Coordinated (UTC). Both are assigned a
value as an ordinary string within double quotes, for example,
"19820102070533.8".</p><p>For DER encoding, the compiler does not check the validity
of the time values. The DER requirements upon those strings are
regarded as a matter for the application to fulfill.</p><a name="SEQUENCE"></a><h2>SEQUENCE</h2><p>The structured types of ASN.1 are constructed from other types
in a manner similar to the concepts of array and struct in  C.</p><p>A <strong>SEQUENCE</strong> in ASN.1 is
comparable with a struct in C and a record in Erlang.
A <strong>SEQUENCE</strong> can be defined as follows:</p><pre>
Pdu ::= SEQUENCE {
   a INTEGER,
   b REAL,
   c OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
   d NULL }      </pre><p>This is a 4-component structure called <strong>Pdu</strong>. By default,
a <strong>SEQUENCE</strong> is represented by a record in Erlang.
It can also be represented as a map; see
<a href="./asn1_getting_started#MAP_SEQ_SET"> Map representation for SEQUENCE and SET</a>.
For each <strong>SEQUENCE</strong> and <strong>SET</strong> in an ASN.1 module an Erlang
record declaration is generated. For <strong>Pdu</strong>, a record
like the following is defined:</p><pre>
-record('Pdu',{a, b, c, d}).      </pre><p>The record declarations for a module <strong>M</strong> are placed in a
separate <strong>M.hrl</strong> file.</p><p>Values can be assigned in Erlang as follows:</p><pre>
MyPdu = #'Pdu'{a=22,b=77.99,c={0,1,2,3,4},d='NULL'}.      </pre><p>The decode functions return a record as result when decoding
a <strong>SEQUENCE</strong> or a <strong>SET</strong>.</p><p>A <strong>SEQUENCE</strong> and a <strong>SET</strong> can contain a component
with a <strong>DEFAULT</strong> keyword followed by the actual value, which
is the default value. The <strong>DEFAULT</strong> keyword means that the
application doing the encoding can omit encoding of the value, which
results in fewer bytes to send to the receiving application.</p><p>An application can use the atom <strong>asn1_DEFAULT</strong> to indicate
that the encoding is to be omitted for that position in
the <strong>SEQUENCE</strong>.</p><p>Depending on the encoding rules, the encoder can also compare
the given value to the default value and automatically omit the
encoding if the values are equal. How much effort the encoder makes
to compare the values depends on the encoding rules. The DER
encoding rules forbid encoding a value equal to the default value,
so it has a more thorough and time-consuming comparison than the
encoders for the other encoding rules.</p><p>In the following example, this ASN.1 specification is used:</p><pre>
File DEFINITIONS AUTOMATIC TAGS ::=
BEGIN
Seq1 ::= SEQUENCE {
    a INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
    b Seq2 DEFAULT {aa TRUE, bb 15}
}

Seq2 ::= SEQUENCE {
    aa BOOLEAN,
    bb INTEGER
}

Seq3 ::= SEQUENCE {
    bs BIT STRING {a(0), b(1), c(2)} DEFAULT {a, c}
}
END </pre><p>Example where the BER encoder is able to omit encoding
of the default values:</p><pre>
1&gt; <span class="input">asn1ct:compile('File', [ber]).</span>
ok
2&gt; <span class="input">'File':encode('Seq1', {'Seq1',asn1_DEFAULT,asn1_DEFAULT}).</span>
{ok,&lt;&lt;48,0&gt;&gt;}
3&gt; <span class="input">'File':encode('Seq1', {'Seq1',1,{'Seq2',true,15}}).</span>
{ok,&lt;&lt;48,0&gt;&gt;}   </pre><p>Example with a named <strong>BIT STRING</strong> where the BER
encoder does not omit the encoding:</p><pre>
4&gt; <span class="input">'File':encode('Seq3', {'Seq3',asn1_DEFAULT).</span>
{ok,&lt;&lt;48,0&gt;&gt;}
5&gt; <span class="input">'File':encode('Seq3', {'Seq3',&lt;&lt;16#101:3&gt;&gt;).</span>
{ok,&lt;&lt;48,4,128,2,5,160&gt;&gt;}     </pre><p>The DER encoder omits the encoding for the same <strong>BIT STRING</strong>:</p><pre>
6&gt; <span class="input">asn1ct:compile('File', [ber,der]).</span>
ok
7&gt; <span class="input">'File':encode('Seq3', {'Seq3',asn1_DEFAULT).</span>
{ok,&lt;&lt;48,0&gt;&gt;}
8&gt; <span class="input">'File':encode('Seq3', {'Seq3',&lt;&lt;16#101:3&gt;&gt;).</span>
{ok,&lt;&lt;48,0&gt;&gt;}     </pre><a name="SET"></a><h2>SET</h2><p>In Erlang, the <strong>SET</strong> type is used exactly as <strong>SEQUENCE</strong>.
Notice that if BER or DER encoding rules are used, decoding a
<strong>SET</strong> is slower than decoding a <strong>SEQUENCE</strong> because the
components must be sorted.</p><h2>Extensibility for SEQUENCE and SET</h2><p>When a <strong>SEQUENCE</strong> or <strong>SET</strong> contains an extension marker
and extension components as the following, the type can get more
components in newer versions of the ASN.1 spec:</p><pre>
SExt ::= SEQUENCE {
           a INTEGER,
           ...,
           b BOOLEAN }</pre><p>In this case it has got a new
component <strong>b</strong>. Thus, incoming messages that are decoded
can have more or fever components than this one.
</p><p>The component <strong>b</strong> is treated as
an original component when encoding a message. In this case, as
it is not an optional element, it must be encoded.
</p><p>During decoding, the <strong>b</strong> field of the record gets the decoded
value of the <strong>b</strong>
component, if present, otherwise the value <strong>asn1_NOVALUE</strong>.</p><a name="MAP_SEQ_SET"></a><h2>Map representation for SEQUENCE and SET</h2><p>If the ASN.1 module has been compiled with option <strong>maps</strong>,
the types <strong>SEQUENCE</strong> and <strong>SET</strong> are represented as maps.</p><p>In the following example, this ASN.1 specification is used:</p><pre>
File DEFINITIONS AUTOMATIC TAGS ::=
BEGIN
Seq1 ::= SEQUENCE {
    a INTEGER DEFAULT 42,
    b BOOLEAN OPTIONAL,
    c IA5String
}
END   </pre><p>Optional fields are to be omitted from the map if they have
no value:</p><pre>
1&gt; <span class="input">asn1ct:compile('File', [per,maps]).</span>
ok
2&gt; <span class="input">{ok,E} = 'File':encode('Seq1', #{a=&gt;0,c=&gt;"string"}).</span>
{ok,&lt;&lt;128,1,0,6,115,116,114,105,110,103&gt;&gt;} </pre><p>When decoding, optional fields will be omitted from the map:</p><pre>
3&gt; <span class="input">'File':decode('Seq1', E).</span>
{ok,#{a =&gt; 0,c =&gt; "string"}}   </pre><p>Default values can be omitted from the map:</p><pre>
4&gt; <span class="input">{ok,E2} = 'File':encode('Seq1', #{c=&gt;"string"}).</span>
{ok,&lt;&lt;0,6,115,116,114,105,110,103&gt;&gt;}
5&gt; <span class="input">'File':decode('Seq1', E2).</span>
{ok,#{a =&gt; 42,c =&gt; "string"}}   </pre><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>It is not allowed to use the atoms <strong>asn1_VALUE</strong> and
<strong>asn1_DEFAULT</strong> with maps.</p></div><a name="CHOICE"></a><h2>CHOICE</h2><p>The type <strong>CHOICE</strong> is a space saver and is similar to the
concept of a 'union' in C.</p><p>Assume the following:</p><pre>
SomeModuleName DEFINITIONS AUTOMATIC TAGS ::=
BEGIN
T ::= CHOICE {
        x REAL,
        y INTEGER,
        z OBJECT IDENTIFIER }
END </pre><p>It is then possible to assign values as follows:</p><pre>
TVal1 = {y,17},
TVal2 = {z,{0,1,2}},</pre><p>A <strong>CHOICE</strong> value is always represented as the tuple
<strong>{ChoiceAlternative, Val}</strong> where <strong>ChoiceAlternative</strong>
is an atom denoting the selected choice alternative.
</p><h2>Extensible CHOICE</h2><p>When a <strong>CHOICE</strong> contains an extension marker and the
decoder detects an unknown alternative of the <strong>CHOICE</strong>,
the value is represented as follows:</p><pre>
{asn1_ExtAlt, BytesForOpenType}</pre><p>Here <strong>BytesForOpenType</strong> is a list of bytes constituting the
encoding of the "unknown" <strong>CHOICE</strong> alternative.</p><a name="SOF"></a><h2>SET OF and SEQUENCE OF</h2><p>The types <strong>SET OF</strong> and <strong>SEQUENCE OF</strong> correspond
to the concept of an array
in several programming languages. The Erlang syntax for
both types is straightforward, for example:</p><pre>
Arr1 ::= SET SIZE (5) OF INTEGER (4..9) 
Arr2 ::= SEQUENCE OF OCTET STRING      </pre><p>In Erlang the following can apply:</p><pre>
Arr1Val = [4,5,6,7,8],
Arr2Val = ["abc",[14,34,54],"Octets"],      </pre><p>Notice that the definition of type <strong>SET OF</strong> implies that
the order of the components is undefined, but in practice there is 
no difference between <strong>SET OF</strong> and <strong>SEQUENCE OF</strong>.
The ASN.1 compiler for Erlang does not randomize the order of the
<strong>SET OF</strong> components before encoding.</p><p>However, for a value of type <strong>SET OF</strong>, the DER
encoding format requires the elements to be sent in ascending
order of their encoding, which implies an expensive sorting
procedure in runtime. Therefore it is recommended to
use <strong>SEQUENCE OF</strong> instead of <strong>SET OF</strong> if possible.</p><a name="ANY"></a><h2>ANY and ANY DEFINED BY</h2><p>The types <strong>ANY</strong> and <strong>ANY DEFINED BY</strong> have been removed
from the standard since 1994. It is recommended not to use
these types any more. They can, however, exist in some old ASN.1
modules. The idea with this type was to leave a "hole" in a 
definition where it was possible to
put unspecified data of any kind, even non-ASN.1 data.</p><p>A value of this type is encoded as an <strong>open type</strong>.</p><p>Instead of <strong>ANY</strong> and <strong>ANY DEFINED BY</strong>, it is
recommended to use
<strong>information object class</strong>, <strong>table constraints</strong>, and
<strong>parameterization</strong>. In particular the construct
<strong>TYPE-IDENTIFIER.@Type</strong> accomplish the same as the
deprecated <strong>ANY</strong>.</p><p>See also
<a href="#Information Object">Information object</a>.</p><a name="NegotiationTypes"></a><h2>EXTERNAL, EMBEDDED PDV, and CHARACTER STRING</h2><p>The types <strong>EXTERNAL</strong>, <strong>EMBEDDED PDV</strong>, and
<strong>CHARACTER STRING</strong> are used in presentation layer negotiation.
They are encoded according to their associated type, see X.680.</p><p>The type <strong>EXTERNAL</strong> had a slightly different associated type
before 1994. X.691 states that encoding must follow
the older associated type. So, generated encode/decode
functions convert values of the newer format to the older format
before encoding. This implies that it is allowed to use
<strong>EXTERNAL</strong> type values of either format for encoding. Decoded
values are always returned in the newer format.</p><h2>Embedded Named Types</h2><p>The structured types previously described can have other named
types as their components. The general syntax to assign a value
to component <strong>C</strong> of a named ASN.1 type <strong>T</strong> in Erlang
is the record syntax <strong>#'T'{'C'=Value}</strong>.
Here <strong>Value</strong> can be a value of yet another type <strong>T2</strong>,
for example:</p><pre>
EmbeddedExample DEFINITIONS AUTOMATIC TAGS ::=
BEGIN
B ::= SEQUENCE {
        a Arr1,
        b T }

Arr1 ::= SET SIZE (5) OF INTEGER (4..9) 

T ::= CHOICE {
        x REAL,
        y INTEGER,
        z OBJECT IDENTIFIER }
        END      </pre><p><strong>SEQUENCE</strong> <strong>b</strong> can be encoded as follows in Erlang:</p><pre>
1&gt; 'EmbeddedExample':encode('B', {'B',[4,5,6,7,8],{x,"7.77"}}).
{ok,&lt;&lt;5,56,0,8,3,55,55,55,46,69,45,50&gt;&gt;} </pre><h2>Naming of Records in .hrl Files</h2><p>When the option <strong>maps</strong> is given, no <strong>.hrl</strong> files
will be generated. The rest of this section describes the behavior
of the compiler when <strong>maps</strong> is not used.</p><p>When an ASN.1 specification is compiled, all defined types of type
<strong>SET</strong> or <strong>SEQUENCE</strong> result in a corresponding record in the
generated <strong>.hrl</strong> file. This is because the values for
<strong>SET</strong> and <strong>SEQUENCE</strong> are represented as records
by default.</p><p>Some special cases of this functionality are presented in the
next section.</p><h2>Embedded Structured Types</h2><p>In ASN.1 it is also possible to have components that are themselves
structured types.
For example, it is possible to have the following:</p><pre>
Emb ::= SEQUENCE {
    a SEQUENCE OF OCTET STRING,
    b SET {
       a INTEGER,
       b INTEGER DEFAULT 66},
    c CHOICE {
       a INTEGER,
       b FooType } }

FooType ::= [3] VisibleString      </pre><p>The following records are generated because of type <strong>Emb</strong>:</p><pre>
-record('Emb,{a, b, c}).
-record('Emb_b',{a, b = asn1_DEFAULT}). % the embedded SET type </pre><p>Values of type <strong>Emb</strong> can be assigned as follows:</p><pre><code class="">
V = #'Emb'{a=["qqqq",[1,2,255]], 
           b = #'Emb_b'{a=99}, 
           c ={b,"Can you see this"}}.</code></pre><p>For an embedded type of type <strong>SEQUENCE</strong>/<strong>SET</strong> in a
<strong>SEQUENCE</strong>/<strong>SET</strong>, the record name is extended with an
underscore and the component name. If the embedded structure is
deeper with the <strong>SEQUENCE</strong>, <strong>SET</strong>, or <strong>CHOICE</strong>
types in the line, each component name/alternative name is
added to the record name.</p><p>Example:</p><pre>
Seq ::= SEQUENCE{
    a CHOICE{
        b SEQUENCE {
           c  INTEGER
        }
    }
}      </pre><p>This results in the following record:</p><pre>
-record('Seq_a_b',{c}).      </pre><p>If the structured type has a component with an embedded
<strong>SEQUENCE OF</strong>/<strong>SET OF</strong> which embedded type in turn
is a <strong>SEQUENCE</strong>/<strong>SET</strong>, it gives a record with the
<strong>SEQUENCE OF</strong>/<strong>SET OF</strong>
addition as in the following example:</p><pre>
Seq ::= SEQUENCE {
    a SEQUENCE OF SEQUENCE {
           b
               }
    c SET OF SEQUENCE {
           d
               }
}      </pre><p>This results in the following records:</p><pre>
-record('Seq_a_SEQOF'{b}).
-record('Seq_c_SETOF'{d}).      </pre><p>A parameterized type is to be considered as an embedded
type. Each time such a type is referenced, an instance of it is
defined. Thus, in the following example a record with name
<strong>'Seq_b'</strong> is generated in the <strong>.hrl</strong> file and is used
to hold values:</p><pre>
Seq ::= SEQUENCE {
    b PType{INTEGER}
}

PType{T} ::= SEQUENCE{
    id T
}      </pre><h2>Recursive Types</h2><p>Types that refer to themselves are called recursive types.
Example:</p><pre>
Rec ::= CHOICE {
     nothing NULL,
     something SEQUENCE {
          a INTEGER,
          b OCTET STRING,
          c Rec }}      </pre><p>This is allowed in ASN.1 and the ASN.1-to-Erlang compiler
supports this recursive type.
A value for this type is assigned in Erlang as follows:</p><pre>
V = {something,#'Rec_something'{a = 77, 
                                b = "some octets here", 
                                c = {nothing,'NULL'}}}.      </pre><h2>ASN.1 Values</h2><p>Values can be assigned to an ASN.1 type within the ASN.1 code
itself, as opposed to the actions in the previous section where
a value was assigned to an ASN.1 type in Erlang. The full value
syntax of ASN.1 is supported and X.680 describes in detail how
to assign values in ASN.1. A short example:</p><pre>
TT ::= SEQUENCE {
   a INTEGER,
   b SET OF OCTET STRING }

tt TT ::= {a 77,b {"kalle","kula"}}    </pre><p>The value defined here can be used in several ways. It can, for
example, be used as the value in some <strong>DEFAULT</strong> component:</p><pre>
SS ::= SET {
    s OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
    val TT DEFAULT tt }    </pre><p>It can also be used from inside an Erlang program. If this ASN.1
code is defined in ASN.1 module <strong>Values</strong>, the ASN.1 value
<strong>tt</strong> can be reached from Erlang as a function call to
<strong>'Values':tt()</strong> as in the following example:</p><pre>
1&gt; <span class="input">Val = 'Values':tt().</span>
{'TT',77,["kalle","kula"]}
2&gt; <span class="input">{ok,Bytes} = 'Values':encode('TT',Val).</span>
{ok,&lt;&lt;48,18,128,1,77,161,13,4,5,107,97,108,108,101,4,4,
      107,117,108,97&gt;&gt;}
4&gt; <span class="input">'Values':decode('TT',Bytes).</span>
{ok,{'TT',77,["kalle","kula"]}}
5&gt;  </pre><p>This example shows that a function is generated by the compiler
that returns a valid Erlang representation of the value, although
the value is of a complex type.</p><p>Furthermore, if the option <strong>maps</strong> is not used,
a macro is generated for each value in the <strong>.hrl</strong>
file. So, the defined value <strong>tt</strong> can also be extracted by
<strong>?tt</strong> in application code.</p><h2>Macros</h2><p>The type <strong>MACRO</strong> is not supported. It is no longer part of
the ASN.1 standard.</p><a name="Information Object"></a><h2>ASN.1 Information Objects (X.681)</h2><p>Information Object Classes, Information Objects, and Information
Object Sets (in the following called classes, objects, and
object sets, respectively) are defined in the standard
definition X.681. Only a brief explanation is given here.</p><p>These constructs makes it possible to define open types, that
is, values of that type can be of any ASN.1 type. Also,
relationships can be defined between different types and
values, as classes can hold types, values, objects, object
sets, and other classes in their fields. A class can be
defined in ASN.1 as follows:</p><pre>
GENERAL-PROCEDURE ::= CLASS {
      &amp;Message,
      &amp;Reply               OPTIONAL,
      &amp;Error               OPTIONAL,
      &amp;id          PrintableString UNIQUE
}
WITH SYNTAX {
      NEW MESSAGE     &amp;Message
      [REPLY           &amp;Reply]
      [ERROR           &amp;Error]
      ADDRESS          &amp;id
}    </pre><p>An object is an instance of a class. An object set is a set
containing objects of a specified class. A definition can look
as follows:</p><pre>
object1 GENERAL-PROCEDURE ::= {
    NEW MESSAGE      PrintableString
    ADDRESS          "home"
}

object2 GENERAL-PROCEDURE ::= {
    NEW MESSAGE INTEGER
    ERROR INTEGER
    ADDRESS "remote"
}</pre><p>The object <strong>object1</strong> is an instance of the class
<strong>GENERAL-PROCEDURE</strong> and has one type field and one
fixed type value field. The object <strong>object2</strong> has also an
optional field <strong>ERROR</strong>, which is a type field. The field
<strong>ADDRESS</strong> is a <strong>UNIQUE</strong> field. Objects in an object set
must have unique values in their <strong>UNIQUE</strong> field, as in
<strong>GENERAL-PROCEDURES</strong>:</p><pre>
GENERAL-PROCEDURES GENERAL-PROCEDURE ::= {
    object1 | object2}    </pre><p>You cannot encode a class, object, or object set, only refer to
it when defining other ASN.1 entities. Typically you refer to a
class as well as to object sets by table constraints and component
relation constraints (X.682) in ASN.1 types, as in the following:</p><pre>
StartMessage  ::= SEQUENCE {
    msgId  GENERAL-PROCEDURE.&amp;id  ({GENERAL-PROCEDURES}),
    content GENERAL-PROCEDURE.&amp;Message ({GENERAL-PROCEDURES}{@msgId}),
    }    </pre><p>In type <strong>StartMessage</strong>, the constraint following field
<strong>content</strong> tells that in a value of type
<strong>StartMessage</strong> the value in field <strong>content</strong> must
come from the same object that is chosen by field <strong>msgId</strong>.</p><p>So, the value
<strong>#'StartMessage'{msgId="home",content="Any Printable String"}</strong>
is legal to encode as a <strong>StartMessage</strong> value. However, the value
<strong>#'StartMessage'{msgId="remote", content="Some String"}</strong>
is illegal as the constraint in <strong>StartMessage</strong> tells that
when you have chosen a value from a specific object in object
set <strong>GENERAL-PROCEDURES</strong> in field 
<strong>msgId</strong>, you must choose a value from that same object in
the content field too. In this second case, it is to be
any <strong>INTEGER</strong> value.</p><p><strong>StartMessage</strong> can in field <strong>content</strong> be
encoded with a value of any type that an object in object set
<strong>GENERAL-PROCEDURES</strong> has in its <strong>NEW MESSAGE</strong> field.
This field refers to a type field
<strong>&amp;Message</strong> in the class. Field <strong>msgId</strong> is always
encoded as a <strong>PrintableString</strong>, as the field refers to a
fixed type in the class.</p><p>In practice, object sets are usually declared to be extensible so
that more objects can be added to the set later. Extensibility is
indicated as follows:</p><pre>
GENERAL-PROCEDURES GENERAL-PROCEDURE ::= {
    object1 | object2, ...}    </pre><p>When decoding a type that uses an extensible set constraint,
it is always possible that the value in field <strong>UNIQUE</strong>
is unknown (that is, the type has been encoded with a later
version of the ASN.1 specification). The unencoded data is then
returned wrapped in a tuple as follows:</p><pre>
{asn1_OPENTYPE,Binary}</pre><p>Here <strong>Binary</strong> is an Erlang binary that contains the encoded
data. (If option <strong>legacy_erlang_types</strong> has been given,
only the binary is returned.)</p><h2>Parameterization (X.683)</h2><p>Parameterization, which is defined in X.683, can be used when
defining types, values, value sets, classes, objects, or object sets.
A part of a definition can be supplied as a parameter. For
example, if a <strong>Type</strong> is used in a definition with a certain
purpose, you want the type name to express the intention. This
can be done with parameterization.</p><p>When many types (or another ASN.1 entity) only differ in some
minor cases, but the structure of the types is similar, only
one general type can be defined and the differences can be supplied
through parameters.</p><p>Example of use of parameterization:</p><pre>
General{Type} ::= SEQUENCE
{
     number     INTEGER,
     string     Type
}
      
T1 ::= General{PrintableString}

T2 ::= General{BIT STRING}</pre><p>An example of a value that can be encoded as type <strong>T1</strong> is
<strong>{12,"hello"}</strong>.</p><p>Notice that the compiler does not generate encode/decode functions
for parameterized types, only for the instances of the parameterized
types. Therefore, if a file contains the types <strong>General{}</strong>,
<strong>T1</strong>, and <strong>T2</strong> as in the previous example, encode/decode
functions are only generated for <strong>T1</strong> and <strong>T2</strong>.
