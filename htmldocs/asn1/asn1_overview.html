describing data structures to be exchanged between distributed
computer systems. The purpose of ASN.1 is to have a platform
and programming language independent notation to express types
using a standardized set of rules for the transformation of
values of a defined type into a stream of bytes. This stream of
bytes can then be sent on any type of communication
channel. This way, two applications written in different
programming languages running on different computers, and with
different internal representation of data, can exchange instances
of structured data types.</p></body></html>
