and named values. (Thanks to Ingars for reporting this
bug.)</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-13257</p> </li><li> <p>The ASN.1 compiler will now emit Dialyzer suppressions

Own Id: OTP-12546 Aux Id: seq12815 </p> </li></ul><h2>Asn1 3.0.3</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
When decoding BER, primitives with an indefinite length
will be immediately rejected. (Thanks to Simon Cornish
for reporting this bug.)</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-12205</p> </li><li> <p>
BER: A bug with compliance to X.680 (200811) s31.2.7 has
been fixed. Basically, when TagDefault is AUTOMATIC then
tags are IMPLICIT unless EXPLICIT is given.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-12318</p> </li><li> <p>
Usage of the <strong>EXTERNAL</strong> 1994 variant type was
broken.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-12326</p> </li></ul><h2>Asn1 3.0.2</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
Several problems where the ASN.1 compiler would crash
when attempting to compile correct specifications have
been corrected.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-12125</p> </li><li> <p>
Robustness when decoding incorrect BER messages has been
improved.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-12145</p> </li></ul><h2>Asn1 3.0.1</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
The ASN.1 compiler now generates code that don't trigger
Dialyzer warnings. Along the way, a few minor bugs were
fixed.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-11372 Aux Id: seq12397 </p> </li></ul><h2>Asn1 3.0</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
Subtyping an extensible ENUMERATED would cause an
compilation error. (Thanks to Morten Nygaard Ãsnes for
reporting this bug.)</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-11700</p> </li><li> <p>When specifying the value for an OCTET STRING in a
specification, the ASN.1 standard clearly states that the
value must be either a bstring or an hstring, but NOT a
cstring. The ASN.1 compiler will now generate a
compilation error if the value of an OCTET STRING is
given as a character string.</p> <p>That is, the following example is now illegal:</p> <p><strong>string OCTET STRING ::= "Now illegal"</strong></p> <p>
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-11727</p> </li><li> <p>
Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the
following applications: </p> <p>
<strong>asn1, common_test, compiler, crypto, debugger, dialyzer, edoc, eldap, erl_docgen, et, eunit, gs, hipe, inets, observer, odbc, os_mon, otp_mibs, parsetools, percept, public_key, reltool, runtime_tools, ssh, syntax_tools, test_server, tools, typer, webtool, wx, xmerl</strong></p> <p>
A new test utility for testing appup files is added to
test_server. This is now used by most applications in
OTP.</p> <p>
(Thanks to Tobias Schlager)</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-11744</p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>
By giving --enable-static-{nifs,drivers} to configure it
is now possible to statically linking of nifs and drivers
to the main Erlang VM binary. At the moment only the asn1
and crypto nifs of the Erlang/OTP nifs and drivers have
been prepared to be statically linked. For more details
see the Installation Guide in the System documentation.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-11258</p> </li><li> <p>Code generation for the <strong>per</strong> and <strong>uper</strong>
backends has been somewhat improved.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-11573</p> </li><li> <p>The OCTET STRING and BIT STRING types now have a more
natural mapping to Erlang types (binary and bitstring,
respectively), which is more efficient and will avoid
useless conversions between lists and
binaries/bitstrings.</p> <p>This is an incompatible change. To revert to the old
mapping to support existing applications, use the
<strong>legacy_erlang_types</strong> option.</p> <p>Impact: There is a potential for better performance,
as it is now possible to avoid conversions between lists
and binaries both in the generated ASN.1 encode/decode
code and in the application itself.</p> <p>
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-11594</p> </li><li> <p>All functions in the <strong>asn1rt</strong> module, as well as
<strong>asn1ct:decode/3</strong> and <strong>asn1ct:encode/3</strong>, are
now deprecated.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-11731</p> </li><li> <p>
Generated .hrl files are now protected from being
included more than once.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-11804</p> </li></ul><h2>Asn1 2.0.4</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
The default value for a <strong>BIT STRING</strong> would not
always be recognized, causing the encoding to be
incorrect for the DER/PER/UPER encodings.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-11319</p> </li><li> <p>
The ASN.1 application would fail to build if the
<strong>.erlang</strong> file printed something to standard output.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-11360</p> </li><li> <p>An union of integer ranges in an INTEGER constraint
could sometimes be interpreted as the intersection of the
range.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-11411 Aux Id: seq12443 </p> </li><li> <p>
Extensible, multiple single value constraints (such as
<strong>INTEGER (1|17, ...)</strong>) would be incorrectly encoded.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-11415</p> </li><li> <p>
The ASN.1 compiler would fail to compile a constraint
with values given for for the extension part (such as
<strong>INTEGER (1..10, ..., 11..20)</strong>).</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-11504</p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>
The new option '<strong>no_ok_wrapper</strong>' generates
M:encode/2 and M:decode/2 functions that don't wrap the
return value in an {ok,...} tuple.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-11314</p> </li></ul><h2>Asn1 2.0.3</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
Open types greater than 16383 bytes will now be correctly
encoded and decoded.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-11262 Aux Id: seq12386, OTP-11223 </p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>For the PER and UPER formats, code generation
especially for encoding has been improved.</p> <p>When encoding BIT STRINGs, values longer than the
maximum size for the BIT STRING type would be truncated
silently - they now cause an exception.</p> <p>Open types greater than 16383 bytes will now be
correctly encoded and decoded.</p> <p>IMPORTANT NOTE: For ASN.1 specifications that depend
on each other, such as the S1AP-* specifications, it is
important to recompile all specifications (compiling some
with this version of the compiler and some with an older
version will not work).</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-11300</p> </li></ul><h2>Asn1 2.0.2</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
Fix some Makefile rules that didn't support silent rules.
Thanks to Anthony Ramine.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-11111</p> </li><li> <p>PER/UPER: A semi-constrained INTEGER with a non-zero
lower bound would be incorrectly decoded. This bug was
introduced in R16.</p> <p>PER/UPER: Given <strong>INTEGER (10..MAX, ...)</strong>,
attempting to decode any integer below 10 would cause the
encoder to enter an infinite loop.</p> <p>PER/UPER: For a type with an extensible SIZE
constraint, sizes outside of the root range were
incorrectly encoded.</p> <p>Given a constraint such as <strong>(SIZE (5, ...))</strong>,
encoding a size less than 5 would fail (PER/UPER).
Similarly, for BER decoding would fail.</p> <p>PER: The encoder did not align a known multiplier
string (such as IA5String) of length 16 bits (exactly) to
an octet boundary.</p> <p>In rare circumstances, DEFAULT values for the UPER
backend could be wrongly encoded.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-11134</p> </li><li> <p>UPER: The compiler would crash when compiling an
ENUMERATED having more than 63 extended values.</p> <p>PER/UPER: A SEQUENCE with more 64 extended values
could not be decoded.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-11153</p> </li><li> <p>
When decoding a SEQUENCE defined inline inside a an
extension addition group, the record named generated by
the decoding code would not match the name in the
generated .hrl file.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-11154 Aux Id: seq12339 </p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p> Postscript files no longer needed for the generation
of PDF files have been removed. </p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-11016</p> </li></ul><h2>Asn1 2.0.1.2</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
When an object set is an actual parameter, the extension
marker for the object set could get lost (which would
cause the decoding of unknown values to fail).</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-10995 Aux Id: seq12290 </p> </li></ul><h2>Asn1 2.0.1.1</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>The generated decoder for the 'per' and 'uper'
backends did not correctly decode ENUMERATEDs with a
single value.</p> <p>The generated encoder for the 'per' and 'uper'
backends generated an empty binary for a top-level type
that did not need to be encoded (such as an ENUMERATED
with a single value). The correct result should be a
binary containing a 0 byte.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-10916 Aux Id: seq12270 </p> </li></ul><h2>Asn1 2.0.1</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
Fixed broken table constraints within a SET OF or
SEQUENCE OF for the BER backend.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-10853 Aux Id: seq12245 </p> </li></ul><h2>Asn1 2.0</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
Encoding SEQUENCEs with multiple extension addition
groups with optional values could fail (depending both on
the specification and whether all values were provided).</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-10664</p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>The options for the ASN.1 compiler has been
drastically simplified. The backend is chosen by using
<strong>ber</strong>, <strong>per</strong>, or <strong>uper</strong>. The options
<strong>optimize</strong>, <strong>nif</strong>, and <strong>driver</strong> are no
longer needed. The old options will still work, but will
issue a warning.</p> <p>Another change is that generated <strong>encode/2</strong>
function will always return a binary (some backends used
to return an iolist).</p> <p>
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-10410 Aux Id: kunagi-254 [165] </p> </li><li> <p>
The ASN.1 compiler generates faster decode functions for
PER and UPER. Some minor improvements have also been made
for PER/UPER encoding, and to the BER backend.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-10519 Aux Id: kunagi-322 [233] </p> </li><li> <p>The ASN.1 compiler will now always include necessary
run-time functions in the generated Erlang modules
(except for <strong>asn1rt_nif</strong> which is still neeeded). If
the option '<strong>inline</strong>' is used the ASN.1 compiler
will generate a warning. But if
'<strong>{inline,OutputFile}</strong>' is use, the ASN.1 compiler
will refuse to compile the file. (Use a <strong>.set.asn</strong>
file if you need to remove the output file.)</p> <p>The '<strong>BIT STRING</strong>' type will now be decoded as
Erlang bitstrings by default. Use the new
<strong>legacy_bit_string</strong> option to encode as lists of
ones and zeroes. (The <strong>compact_bit_string</strong> option
still works as before.)</p> <p>Open types are now always returned as binaries (when
there is no information allowing them to be decoded).</p> <p>
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-10588 Aux Id: kunagi-341 [252] </p> </li></ul><h2>Asn1 1.8.1</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
ASN.1 decoders generated with the options <strong>-bber_bin +optimize +nif</strong> would decode open types with a size
larger than 511 incorrectly. That bug could cause
decoding by <strong>public_key</strong> to fail. The bug was in the
NIF library <strong>asn1_erl_nif.so</strong>; therefore there is no
need re-compile ASN.1 specifications that had the
problem.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-10805 Aux Id: seq12244 </p> </li><li> <p>
Encoding SEQUENCEs with multiple extension addition

Own Id: OTP-10811 Aux Id: OTP-10664 </p> </li></ul><h2>Asn1 1.8</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
Encoding and decoding of integer ranges can now be done
with an upper bound larger than the previous limit of
16^10. The new upper bound in per encoding and decodings
for constrained whole numbers is 2^2040 (close to 16^508)</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-10128</p> </li><li> <p>
Per encoding/decoding now works correctly for single
value subtyping of an integer type where a subtype is a
predefined value. Previously a predefined value could
cause a non-valid range-check in the generated Erlang
code for per encoding/decoding due to a bug in the
constraint checking.</p> <p>

Own Id: OTP-9946</p> </li></ul><h2>Asn1 1.6.19</h2><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>
The linked-in driver used for ber decode and per encode
has been replaced with nifs. To enable the usage of nifs
pass the nif option to erlc or asn1rt:compile when

you have to recompile your ASN1 modules with the current
version of asn1 application as the linked-in driver

improvements.</p> <p>Most notable:</p> <ul><li> Lots of cross compilation improvements. The old cross compilation support was more or less non-existing as well as broken. Please, note that the cross compilation support should still be considered as experimental. Also note that old cross compilation configurations cannot be used without modifications. For more information on cross compiling Erlang/OTP see the <strong>$ERL_TOP/INSTALL-CROSS.md</strong> file. </li><li> Support for staged install using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/DESTDIR.html">DESTDIR</a>. The old broken <strong>INSTALL_PREFIX</strong> has also been fixed. For more information see the <strong>$ERL_TOP/INSTALL.md</strong> file. </li><li> Documentation of the <strong>release</strong> target of the top <strong>Makefile</strong>. For more information see the <strong>$ERL_TOP/INSTALL.md</strong> file. </li><li> <strong>make install</strong> now by default creates relative symbolic links instead of absolute ones. For more information see the <strong>$ERL_TOP/INSTALL.md</strong> file. </li><li> <strong>$ERL_TOP/configure --help=recursive</strong> now works and prints help for all applications with <strong>configure</strong> scripts. </li><li> Doing <strong>make install</strong>, or <strong>make release</strong> directly after <strong>make all</strong> no longer triggers miscellaneous rebuilds. </li><li> Existing bootstrap system is now used when doing <strong>make install</strong>, or <strong>make release</strong> without a preceding <strong>make all</strong>. </li><li> The <strong>crypto</strong> and <strong>ssl</strong> applications use the same runtime library path when dynamically linking against <strong>libssl.so</strong> and <strong>libcrypto.so</strong>. The runtime library search path has also been extended. </li><li> The <strong>configure</strong> scripts of <strong>erl_interface</strong> and <strong>odbc</strong> now search for thread libraries and thread library quirks the same way as ERTS do. </li><li> The <strong>configure</strong> script of the <strong>odbc</strong> application now also looks for odbc libraries in <strong>lib64</strong> and <strong>lib/64</strong> directories when building on a 64-bit system. </li><li> The <strong>config.h.in</strong> file in the <strong>erl_interface</strong> application is now automatically generated in instead of statically updated which reduces the risk of <strong>configure</strong> tests without any effect. </li></ul> <p>(Thanks to Henrik Riomar for suggestions and

Own Id: OTP-8256</p> </li></ul><h2>Asn1 1.6.11</h2><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>
A new option <strong>{n2n,TypeName}</strong> can be used to
enable generation of conversion functions from name to number 
and vice versa for selected ENUMERATION types. 
The option can be repeated many times in order to specify several 
types in the same file.<br/>
If the <strong>TypeName</strong> specified does not exists or is not an 
ENUMERATION type, the compilation will be terminated with an 
error code.<br/>
Below follows an example on how to use the option from the command line with <strong>erlc</strong>:<br/>
