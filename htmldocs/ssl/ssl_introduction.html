Sockets Layer (SSL), are cryptographic protocols designed to
provide communications security over a computer network. The protocols
use X.509 certificates and hence public key (asymmetric) cryptography to
authenticate the counterpart with whom they communicate,
and to exchange a symmetric key for payload encryption. The protocol provides
data/message confidentiality (encryption), integrity (through message authentication code checks)
and host verification (through certificate path validation). DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) that
is based on TLS but datagram oriented instead of stream oriented.</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the Erlang
programming language, the concepts of OTP, and has a basic
understanding of SSL/TLS/DTLS.</p></body></html>
