When SSL/TLS performs certificate path validation according to
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt">RFC 5280 </a>
it should also perform CRL validation checks. To enable the CRL
checks the application needs access to CRLs. A database of CRLs
can be set up in many different ways. This module provides the
behavior of the API needed to integrate an arbitrary CRL cache
with the erlang ssl application. It is also used by the
application itself to provide a simple default implementation of
a CRL cache.

This function may choose to only look in the cache or to follow distribution point
links depending on how the cache is administrated. </p><p>The <strong>Issuer</strong> argument contains the issuer name of the
certificate to be checked.  Normally the returned CRL should
be issued by this issuer, except if the <strong>cRLIssuer</strong> field
of <strong>DistributionPoint</strong> has a value, in which case that
value should be used instead.</p><p>In an earlier version of this API, the <strong>lookup</strong>
function received two arguments, omitting <strong>Issuer</strong>.  For
compatibility, this is still supported: if there is no
<strong>lookup/3</strong> function in the callback module,
<strong>lookup/2</strong> is called instead.</p><h2>select(Issuer, DbHandle) -&gt; CRLs</h2><p>Select the CRLs in the cache that are issued by <strong>Issuer</strong></p><ul><li><span class="v"> Issuer = </span></li><li><span class="v"> DbHandle = </span></li></ul><p>Select the CRLs in the cache that are issued by <strong>Issuer</strong> </p></body></html>
