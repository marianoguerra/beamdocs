  sockets.</p><p>
The ssl application is an implementation of the SSL, TLS and DTLS protocols in Erlang.
For current statement of standards compliance see the <a href="standards_compliance">User's Guide</a>.</p><h3>DEPENDENCIES</h3><p>The SSL application uses the <strong>public_key</strong>, <strong>asn1</strong> and
Crypto application to handle public keys and encryption, hence
these applications must be loaded for the SSL application to work. 
In an embedded environment this means they must be started with
<strong>application:start/[1,2]</strong> before the SSL application is 
started.</p><h3>CONFIGURATION</h3><p>The application environment configuration parameters in this section 
are defined for the SSL application. For more information 
about configuration parameters, see the 
<a href="./application">application(3)</a>
manual page in Kernel.</p><p>The environment parameters can be set on the command line,
for example:</p><p><strong>erl -ssl protocol_version "['tlsv1.2', 'tlsv1.1']"</strong></p><dl><dt><strong>protocol_version = </strong><a href="./ssl#type-protocol">ssl:ssl_tls_protocol()</a><strong>&lt;optional&gt;</strong></dt><dd><p>Protocol supported by started clients and
servers. If this option is not set, it defaults to all
TLS protocols currently supported by the SSL application.
This option can be overridden by the version option
to <strong>ssl:connect/[2,3]</strong> and <strong>ssl:listen/2</strong>.</p></dd><dt><strong>dtls_protocol_version = </strong><a href="./ssl#type-protocol">ssl:dtls_protocol()</a><strong>&lt;optional&gt;</strong></dt><dd><p>Protocol supported by started clients and
servers. If this option is not set, it defaults to all
DTLS protocols currently supported by the SSL application.
This option can be overridden by the version option
to <strong>ssl:connect/[2,3]</strong> and <strong>ssl:listen/2</strong>.</p></dd><dt><strong>session_lifetime = integer() &lt;optional&gt;</strong></dt><dd><p>Maximum lifetime of the session data in seconds. Defaults to 24 hours which is the maximum
recommended lifetime by <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/5246rfc.txt">RFC 5246</a>. However
sessions may be invalidated earlier due to the maximum limitation of the session cache table.
</p></dd><dt><strong>session_cb = atom() &lt;optional&gt;</strong></dt><dd><p>Name of the session cache callback module that implements
the <strong>ssl_session_cache_api</strong> behavior. Defaults to
<strong>ssl_session_cache</strong>.</p></dd><dt><strong>session_cb_init_args = proplist:proplist() &lt;optional&gt;</strong></dt><dd><p>List of extra user-defined arguments to the <strong>init</strong> function
in the session cache callback module. Defaults to <strong>[]</strong>.</p></dd><dt><strong>session_cache_client_max = integer() &lt;optional&gt;</strong><br/></dt><dd><p>Limits the growth of the clients session cache, that is
how many sessions towards servers that are cached to be used by
new client connections.  If the maximum number of sessions is
reached, the current cache entries will be invalidated
regardless of their remaining lifetime. Defaults to
1000. Recommended ssl-8.2.1 or later for this option to work as intended.</p></dd><dt> <strong>session_cache_server_max = integer() &lt;optional&gt;</strong></dt><dd><p>Limits the growth of the servers session cache, that is
how many client sessions are cached by the server. If the
maximum number of sessions is reached, the current cache entries
will be invalidated regardless of their remaining
lifetime. Defaults to 1000. Recommended ssl-8.2.1 or later for this option to work as intended.</p></dd><dt><strong>ssl_pem_cache_clean = integer() &lt;optional&gt;</strong></dt><dd> <p>
Number of milliseconds between PEM cache validations. Defaults to 2 minutes.
</p> <a href="./ssl#clear_pem_cache-0">ssl:clear_pem_cache/0</a> </dd><dt><strong>bypass_pem_cache = boolean() &lt;optional&gt;</strong></dt><dd> <p>Introduced in ssl-8.0.2. Disables the PEM-cache.
Can be used as a workaround for the PEM-cache bottleneck
before ssl-8.1.1. Defaults to false.
</p> </dd><dt><strong>alert_timeout = integer() &lt;optional&gt;</strong></dt><dd> <p>
Number of milliseconds between sending of a fatal alert and
closing the connection. Waiting a little while improves the
peers chances to properly receiving the alert so it may
shutdown gracefully. Defaults to 5000 milliseconds.   
</p> </dd><dt><strong>internal_active_n = integer() &lt;optional&gt;</strong></dt><dd> <p>
For TLS connections this value is used to handle the
internal socket. As the implementation was changed from an
active once to an active N behavior (N = 100), for
performance reasons, this option exist for possible tweaking
or restoring of the old behavior (internal_active_n = 1) in
unforeseen scenarios.  The option will not affect erlang
distribution over TLS that will always run in active N mode.
Added in ssl-9.1 (OTP-21.2).
</p> </dd></dl><h3>ERROR LOGGER AND EVENT HANDLERS</h3><p>The SSL application uses the default <a href="./error_logger">OTP error logger</a> to log
unexpected errors and TLS/DTLS alerts. The logging of TLS/DTLS alerts may be
turned off with the <strong>log_alert</strong> option. </p><h3>SEE ALSO</h3><p><a href="./application">application(3)</a></p><h2>ssl</h2><p>Interface Functions for Secure Socket Layer</p><p>

tuple will be converted to a five tuple with the last element
"second_element"_passive) and <strong>{gen_udp, udp, udp_closed, udp_error}</strong> for DTLS (might also be changed to five tuple in
the future). Can be used to customize the transport layer. The
tag values should be the values used by the underlying
transport in its active mode messages. For TLS the callback
module must implement a reliable transport protocol, behave as
<strong>gen_tcp</strong>, and have functions corresponding to
<strong>inet:setopts/2</strong>, <strong>inet:getopts/2</strong>,
<strong>inet:peername/1</strong>, <strong>inet:sockname/1</strong>, and
<strong>inet:port/1</strong>.  The callback <strong>gen_tcp</strong> is treated
specially and calls <strong>inet</strong> directly. For DTLS this
feature must be considered exprimental.

is supplied it overrides option <strong>cacertfile</strong>.</p><span class="name">server_cafile</span><p>Path to a file containing PEM-encoded CA
certificates. The CA certificates are used to build the server
certificate chain and for client authentication. The CAs are
also used in the list of acceptable client CAs passed to the
client when a certificate is requested. Can be omitted if
there is no need to verify the client and if there are no
intermediate CAs for the server certificate.</p><span class="name">dh_der</span><p>The DER-encoded Diffie-Hellman parameters. If

parameters to be used by the server if a cipher suite using
Diffie Hellman key exchange is negotiated. If not specified,
default parameters are used.</p><span class="name">server_verify_type</span><p>A server only does x509-path validation in mode
<strong>verify_peer</strong>, as it then sends a certificate request to
the client (this message is not sent if the verify option is
<strong>verify_none</strong>).  You can then also want to specify option
<strong>fail_if_no_peer_cert</strong>. </p><span class="name">fail_if_no_peer_cert</span><p>Used together with <strong>{verify, verify_peer}</strong> by an
TLS/DTLS server.  If set to <strong>true</strong>, the server fails if
the client does not have a certificate to send, that is, sends
an empty certificate. If set to <strong>false</strong>, it fails only if
the client sends an invalid certificate (an empty certificate
is considered valid). Defaults to false.</p><span class="name">server_reuse_sessions</span><p>The boolean value true specifies that the server will
agree to reuse sessions. Setting it to false will result in an empty
session table, that is no sessions will be reused. 
See also option <a href="#type-server_reuse_session">reuse_session</a>
</p><span class="name">server_reuse_session</span><p>Enables the TLS/DTLS server to have a local policy
for deciding if a session is to be reused or not.  Meaningful
only if <strong>reuse_sessions</strong> is set to <strong>true</strong>.

<strong>PeerCert</strong> is a DER-encoded certificate,
<strong>Compression</strong> is an enumeration integer, and
<strong>CipherSuite</strong> is of type <strong>ciphersuite()</strong>.</p><span class="name">server_alpn</span><p>Indicates the server will try to perform
Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN).</p><p>The list of protocols is in order of preference. The
protocol negotiated will be the first in the list that
matches one of the protocols advertised by the client. If no
protocol matches, the server will fail the connection with a
"no_application_protocol" alert.</p><p>The negotiated protocol can be retrieved using the
<strong>negotiated_protocol/1</strong> function.</p><span class="name">server_next_protocol</span><p>List of protocols to send to the client if the client
indicates that it supports the Next Protocol extension. The

preference.</p><span class="name">sni_hosts</span><p>If the server receives a SNI (Server Name Indication) from the client
matching a host listed in the <strong>sni_hosts</strong> option, the specific options for
that host will override previously specified options.

The function should be defined as:
fun(ServerName :: string()) -&gt; <a href="#type-server_option">[server_option()] </a>
and can be specified as a fun or as named <strong>fun module:function/1</strong>
The option <strong>sni_fun</strong>, and <strong>sni_hosts</strong> are mutually exclusive.</p><span class="name">client_renegotiation</span><p>In protocols that support client-initiated
renegotiation, the cost of resources of such an operation is
higher for the server than the client. This can act as a
vector for denial of service attacks. The SSL application
already takes measures to counter-act such attempts, but
client-initiated renegotiation can be strictly disabled by
setting this option to <strong>false</strong>. The default value is
<strong>true</strong>.  Note that disabling renegotiation can result in
long-lived connections becoming unusable due to limits on the
number of messages the underlying cipher suite can
encipher.</p><span class="name">honor_cipher_order</span><p>If true, use the server's preference for cipher
selection. If false (the default), use the client's
preference.</p><span class="name">honor_ecc_order</span><p>If true, use the server's preference for ECC curve
selection. If false (the default), use the client's
preference.</p><span class="name">server_signature_algs</span><p> The algorithms specified by this option will be the
ones accepted by the server in a signature algorithm
negotiation, introduced in TLS-1.2. The algorithms will also
be offered to the client if a client certificate is
requested. For more details see the <a href="#type-client_signature_algs">corresponding client option</a>.

it should also perform CRL validation checks. To enable the CRL
checks the application needs access to CRLs. A database of CRLs

Defines the API for the TLS session cache so
that the data storage scheme can be replaced by
defining a new callback module implementing this API.
</p><h2>Data Types</h2><span class="name">session_cache_ref</span><span class="name">session_cache_key</span><p>A key to an entry in the session cache.</p><span class="name">partial_key</span><p>The opaque part of the key. Does not need to be handled
by the callback.</p><span class="name">session</span><p>The session data that is stored for each session.</p><h2>Functions</h2><h3>delete(Cache, Key) -&gt; _</h3><p>Deletes a cache entry.</p><ul><li><span class="v">Cache = </span></li><li><span class="v">Key =  </span></li></ul><p>Deletes a cache entry.

return a new accumulator, which is passed to the next call.
The function returns the final value of the accumulator.

</p><p>Performs possible initializations of the cache and returns
a reference to it that is used as parameter to the other
API functions. Is called by the cache handling processes
<strong>init</strong> function, hence putting the same requirements on it
as a normal process <strong>init</strong> function. This function is
called twice when starting the SSL application, once with
the role client and once with the role server, as the SSL
application must be prepared to take on both roles.
