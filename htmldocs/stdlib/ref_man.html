automatically as needed. A default value is used for entries that have not
been explicitly set.Arrays uses <em>zero</em>-based indexing. This is a deliberate design
choice and differs from other Erlang data structures, for example,
tuples.Unless specified by the user when the array is created, the default
value is the atom <strong>undefined</strong>. There is no difference between an
unset entry and an entry that has been explicitly set to the same value
as the default one (compare
<a href="#reset-2">reset-2</a>). If you need to
differentiate between unset and set entries, ensure that the default value
cannot be confused with the values of set entries.The array never shrinks automatically. If an index <strong>I</strong> has been used
to set an entry successfully, all indices in the range [0,<strong>I</strong>] stay
accessible unless the array size is explicitly changed by calling
<a href="#resize-2">resize-2</a>.<em>Examples:</em>Create a fixed-size array with entries 0-9 set to <strong>undefined</strong>:<pre>
A0 = array:new(10).
10 = array:size(A0).</pre>Create an extendible array and set entry 17 to <strong>true</strong>, causing the
array to grow automatically:<pre>
A1 = array:set(17, true, array:new()).
18 = array:size(A1).</pre>Read back a stored value:<pre>
true = array:get(17, A1).</pre>Accessing an unset entry returns default value:<pre>
undefined = array:get(3, A1)</pre>Accessing an entry beyond the last set entry also returns the default
value, if the array does not have fixed size:<pre>
undefined = array:get(18, A1).</pre>"Sparse" functions ignore default-valued entries:<pre>
A2 = array:set(4, false, A1).
[{4, false}, {17, true}] = array:sparse_to_orddict(A2).</pre>An extendible array can be made fixed-size later:<pre>
A3 = array:fix(A2).</pre>A fixed-size array does not grow automatically and does not allow
accesses beyond the last set entry:<pre>
{'EXIT',{badarg,_}} = (catch array:set(18, true, A3)).
{'EXIT',{badarg,_}} = (catch array:get(18, A3)).</pre></p><h2>Data Types</h2><span class="name">array</span><p>A functional, extendible array. The representation is not documented

</p><h2>assert.hrl</h2><p>Assert macros.</p><p>The include file <strong>assert.hrl</strong> provides macros for inserting
assertions in your program code.Include the following directive in the module from which the function is
called:<pre><code class="">
-include_lib("stdlib/include/assert.hrl").</code></pre>When an assertion succeeds, the assert macro yields the atom <strong>ok</strong>.
When an assertion fails, an exception of type <strong>error</strong> is generated.
The associated error term has the form <strong>{Macro, Info}</strong>. <strong>Macro</strong>
is the macro name, for example, <strong>assertEqual</strong>. <strong>Info</strong> is a list
of tagged values, such as <strong>[{module, M}, {line, L}, ...]</strong>, which
gives more information about the location and cause of the exception. All
entries in the <strong>Info</strong> list are optional; do not rely programmatically
on any of them being present.Each assert macro has a corresponding version with an extra argument,
for adding comments to assertions. These can for example be printed as
part of error reports, to clarify the meaning of the check that
failed. For example, <strong>?assertEqual(0, fib(0), "Fibonacci is defined for zero")</strong>. The comment text can be any character data (string,
UTF8-binary, or deep list of such data), and will be included in the
error term as <strong>{comment, Text}</strong>.If the macro <strong>NOASSERT</strong> is defined when <strong>assert.hrl</strong> is read
by the compiler, the macros are defined as equivalent to the atom
<strong>ok</strong>. The test will not be performed and there is no cost at runtime.For example, using <strong>erlc</strong> to compile your modules, the following
disables all assertions:<pre><code class="">
erlc -DNOASSERT=true *.erl</code></pre>(The value of <strong>NOASSERT</strong> does not matter, only the fact that it is
defined.)A few other macros also have effect on the enabling or disabling of
assertions:<ul><li><p>If <strong>NODEBUG</strong> is defined, it implies <strong>NOASSERT</strong> (unless
<strong>DEBUG</strong> is also defined, which overrides <strong>NODEBUG</strong>).</p> </li><li><p>If <strong>ASSERT</strong> is defined, it overrides <strong>NOASSERT</strong>, that
is, the assertions remain enabled.</p></li></ul>If you prefer, you can thus use only <strong>DEBUG</strong>/<strong>NODEBUG</strong> as the
main flags to control the behavior of the assertions (which is useful if
you have other compiler conditionals or debugging macros controlled by
those flags), or you can use <strong>ASSERT</strong>/<strong>NOASSERT</strong> to control only
the assert macros.</p><h3>Macros</h3><dl><dt><strong>assert(BoolExpr)</strong></dt><dd></dd><dt><strong>assert(BoolExpr, Comment)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Tests that <strong>BoolExpr</strong> completes normally returning

Tools such as Debugger and Xref require the debug information to
be included.</p><div class="alert alert-warning"><h4 class="alert-heading">Warning</h4><p>Source code can be reconstructed from the debug information.
To prevent this, use encrypted debug information (see below).</p></div><p>The debug information can also be removed from BEAM files
using <a href="#strip/1">strip/1</a>,
<a href="#strip_files/1">strip_files/1</a>, and/or
<a href="#strip_release/1">strip_release/1</a>.</p><h3>Reconstruct Source Code</h3><p>The following example shows how to reconstruct Erlang source code from
the debug information in a BEAM file <strong>Beam</strong>:</p><pre><code class="">
{ok,{_,[{abstract_code,{_,AC}}]}} = beam_lib:chunks(Beam,[abstract_code]).
io:fwrite("~s~n", [erl_prettypr:format(erl_syntax:form_list(AC))]).</code></pre><h3>Encrypted Debug Information</h3><p>The debug information can be encrypted to keep
the source code secret, but still be able to use tools such as
Debugger or Xref.</p><p>To use encrypted debug information, a key must be provided to
the compiler and <strong>beam_lib</strong>. The key is specified as a string.
It is recommended that the string contains at least 32 characters and
that both upper and lower case letters as well as digits and
special characters are used.</p><p>The default type (and currently the only type) of crypto
algorithm is <strong>des3_cbc</strong>, three rounds of DES. The key string
is scrambled using
<a href="../erts/erlang#md5/1">erts/erlang#md5/1</a>
to generate the keys used for <strong>des3_cbc</strong>.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>As far as we know by the time of writing, it is
infeasible to break <strong>des3_cbc</strong> encryption without any
knowledge of the key. Therefore, as long as the key is kept
safe and is unguessable, the encrypted debug information
<em>should</em> be safe from intruders.</p></div><p>The key can be provided in the following two ways:</p><ul><li> <p>Use Compiler option <strong>{debug_info_key,Key}</strong>, see
<a href="../compiler/compile#debug_info_key">compiler/compile#debug_info_key</a>
and function
<a href="#crypto_key_fun/1">crypto_key_fun/1</a>
to register a fun that returns the key whenever
<strong>beam_lib</strong> must decrypt the debug information.</p> <p>If no such fun is registered, <strong>beam_lib</strong> instead
searches for an <strong>.erlang.crypt</strong> file, see the next section.</p> </li><li> <p>Store the key in a text file named <strong>.erlang.crypt</strong>.</p> <p>In this case, Compiler option <strong>encrypt_debug_info</strong>
can be used, see
<a href="../compiler/compile#encrypt_debug_info">compiler/compile#encrypt_debug_info</a>.
</p> </li></ul><h3>.erlang.crypt</h3><p><strong>beam_lib</strong> searches for <strong>.erlang.crypt</strong> in the current
directory and then the home directory for the current user. If
the file is found and contains a key, <strong>beam_lib</strong>
implicitly creates a crypto key fun and registers it.</p><p>File <strong>.erlang.crypt</strong> is to contain a single list of tuples:</p><pre><code class="">
{debug_info, Mode, Module, Key}</code></pre><p><strong>Mode</strong> is the type of crypto algorithm; currently, the only
allowed value is <strong>des3_cbc</strong>. <strong>Module</strong> is either an
atom, in which case <strong>Key</strong> is only used for the module
<strong>Module</strong>, or <strong>[]</strong>, in which case <strong>Key</strong> is
used for all modules. <strong>Key</strong> is the non-empty key string.</p><p><strong>Key</strong> in the first tuple where both <strong>Mode</strong> and
<strong>Module</strong> match is used.</p><p>The following is an example of an <strong>.erlang.crypt</strong> file that returns
the same key for all modules:</p><pre><code class="">
[{debug_info, des3_cbc, [], "%&gt;7}|pc/DM6Cga*68$Mw]L#&amp;_Gejr]G^"}].</code></pre><p>The following is a slightly more complicated example of an
<strong>.erlang.crypt</strong> providing one key for module
<strong>t</strong> and another key for all other modules:</p><pre><code class="">
[{debug_info, des3_cbc, t, "My KEY"},
 {debug_info, des3_cbc, [], "%&gt;7}|pc/DM6Cga*68$Mw]L#&amp;_Gejr]G^"}].</code></pre><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>Do not use any of the keys in these examples.

a zero-based offset into a <strong>binary()</strong> and <strong>Length</strong> is the
length of that part. As input to functions in this module, a reverse
part specification is allowed, constructed with a negative
<strong>Length</strong>, so that the part of the binary begins at <strong>Start</strong> +
<strong>Length</strong> and is -<strong>Length</strong> long. This is useful for referencing
the last <strong>N</strong> bytes of a binary as <strong>{size(Binary), -N}</strong>. The
functions in this module always return <strong>part()</strong>s with positive
<strong>Length</strong>.</p><h2>Functions</h2><h3>at/2</h3><p>Return the byte at a specific position in a binary.</p><p>Returns the byte at position <strong><span class="anno">Pos</span></strong> (zero-based) in

means either <strong>&lt;&lt;"functional"&gt;&gt;</strong> or

alternatives; when only a single binary is specified, the set has
only one element. The order of alternatives in a pattern is
not significant.</p><p>The list of binaries used for search alternatives must be flat and

use of <a href="#copy/1">copy/1</a>. By copying a
binary, one can dereference the original, possibly large, binary that a

inserting it in <strong>gb_sets:set()</strong> if it references a binary more than
twice the data size we want to keep. Of course,
different rules apply when copying to different programs.</p><p>Binary sharing occurs whenever binaries are taken apart.
This is the fundamental reason why binaries are fast,
decomposition can always be done with O(1) complexity. In rare
circumstances this data sharing is however undesirable, why this
function together with <strong>copy/1</strong> can be useful when optimizing
for memory use.</p><p>Example of binary sharing:</p><pre><code class="">
1&gt; A = binary:copy(&lt;&lt;1&gt;&gt;, 100).
&lt;&lt;1,1,1,1,1 ...
2&gt; byte_size(A).

    conversions.</p><p>This module provides computation of local and universal time,
day of the week, and many time conversion functions.Time is local when it is adjusted in accordance with the current
time zone and daylight saving. Time is universal when it reflects
the time at longitude zero, without any adjustment for daylight
saving. Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) time is also called
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).The time functions <strong>local_time/0</strong> and
<strong>universal_time/0</strong> in this module both return date
and time. The is because separate functions for date
and time can result in a date/time combination that is displaced
by 24 hours. This occurs if one of the functions is called
before midnight, and the other after midnight. This problem also
applies to the Erlang BIFs <strong>date/0</strong> and <strong>time/0</strong>, and
their use is strongly discouraged if a reliable date/time stamp
is required.All dates conform to the Gregorian calendar. This calendar was
introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582 and was used in all
Catholic countries from this year. Protestant parts of Germany
and the Netherlands adopted it in 1698, England followed in 1752,
and Russia in 1918 (the October revolution of 1917 took place in
November according to the Gregorian calendar).The Gregorian calendar in this module is extended back to year 0.
For a given date, the <em>gregorian days</em> is the number of
days up to and including the date specified. Similarly,
the <em>gregorian seconds</em> for a specified date and time is
the number of seconds up to and including the specified date
and time.For computing differences between epochs in time, use
the functions counting gregorian days or seconds. If epochs are
specified as local time, they must be converted to universal time
to get the correct value of the elapsed time between epochs.
Use of function <strong>time_difference/2</strong> is discouraged.Different definitions exist for the week of the year.
This module contains a week of the year implementation
conforming to the ISO 8601 standard. As the week number for a
specified date can fall on the previous, the current, or on the next
year, it is important to specify both the year and the week number.
Functions <strong>iso_week_number/0</strong> and <strong>iso_week_number/1</strong>
return a tuple of the year and the week number.</p><h2>Data Types</h2><span class="name">datetime</span><span class="name">datetime1970</span><span class="name">date</span><span class="name">year</span><p>Year cannot be abbreviated. For example, 93 denotes year

The
stored terms, in this module called <em>objects</em>, are tuples
such that one element is defined to be the key. A Dets
<em>table</em> is a collection of objects with the key at the same
position stored on a file.This module is used by the Mnesia application, and is provided
"as is" for users who are interested in efficient storage of Erlang
terms on disk only. Many applications only need to store some
terms in a file. Mnesia adds transactions, queries, and
distribution. The size of Dets files cannot exceed 2 GB. If larger
tables are needed, table fragmentation in Mnesia can be used.Three types of Dets tables exist:<ul><li><p><strong>set</strong>. A table of this type has at most one object with a
given key. If an object with a key already present in the
table is inserted, the existing object is overwritten by the new
object.</p> </li><li><p><strong>bag</strong>. A table of this type has zero or more different
objects with a given key.</p> </li><li><p><strong>duplicate_bag</strong>. A table of this type has zero or more
possibly matching objects with a given key.</p> </li></ul>Dets tables must be opened before they can be updated or read,
and when finished they must be properly closed. If a table is not
properly closed, Dets automatically repairs the table.
This can take a substantial time if the table is large. A Dets
table is closed when the process which opened the table
terminates. If many Erlang processes (users) open the same Dets
table, they share the table. The table is properly closed
when all users have either terminated or closed the table. Dets
tables are not properly closed if the Erlang runtime system
terminates abnormally.As all operations performed by Dets are disk operations, it
is important to realize that a single look-up operation involves a
series of disk seek and read operations. The Dets functions
are therefore much slower than the corresponding
<a href="ets">ets</a> functions,
although Dets exports a similar interface.Dets organizes data as a linear hash list and the hash list
grows gracefully as more data is inserted into the table. Space
management on the file is performed by what is called a buddy
system. The current implementation keeps the entire buddy system
in RAM, which implies that if the table gets heavily fragmented,
quite some memory can be used up. The only way to defragment a
table is to close it and then open it again with option <strong>repair</strong>
set to <strong>force</strong>.Notice that type <strong>ordered_set</strong> in Ets is not yet
provided by Dets, neither is the limited support for
concurrent updates that makes a sequence of <strong>first</strong> and
<strong>next</strong> calls safe to use on fixed ETS tables. Both these
features may be provided by Dets in a future release of
Erlang/OTP. Until then, the Mnesia application (or some
user-implemented method for locking) must be used to implement safe
concurrency. Currently, no Erlang/OTP library has support for
ordered disk-based term storage.All Dets functions return <strong>{error, Reason}</strong> if an error
occurs (<a href="#first/1">first/1</a> and
<a href="#next/2">next/2</a> are exceptions, they
exit the process with the error tuple). If badly formed arguments are
specified, all functions exit the process with a <strong>badarg</strong>
message.</p><h2>Data Types</h2><span class="name">access</span><span class="name">auto_save</span><span class="name">bindings_cont</span><p>Opaque continuation used by <a href="#match/1">match/1</a> and <a href="#match/3">match/3</a>.</p><span class="name">cont</span><p>Opaque continuation used by <a href="#bchunk/2">bchunk/2</a>.</p><span class="name">keypos</span><span class="name">match_spec</span><p>Match specifications, see section

where <strong><span class="anno">Data</span></strong> is a list of

with objects created by calling the input function
<strong><span class="anno">InitFun</span></strong>,
see below. The reason for using this function rather than
calling <strong>insert/2</strong> is that of efficiency. Notice
that the input functions are called by the process that
handles requests to the Dets table, not by the calling
process.</p><p>When called with argument <strong>read</strong>, function
<strong><span class="anno">InitFun</span></strong> is assumed to return <strong>end_of_input</strong>
when there is no more input, or <strong>{Objects, Fun}</strong>, where
<strong>Objects</strong> is a list of objects and <strong>Fun</strong> is a new
input function. Any other value <strong>Value</strong> is returned as an error
<strong>{error, {init_fun, Value}}</strong>. Each input function is
called exactly once, and if an error occurs, the last
function is called with argument <strong>close</strong>, the reply
of which is ignored.</p><p>If the table type is <strong>set</strong> and more
than one object exists with a given key, one of the objects is
chosen. This is not necessarily the last object with the given
key in the sequence of objects returned by the input
functions. Avoid duplicate keys, otherwise the file becomes 
unnecessarily fragmented. This holds also for duplicated
objects stored in tables of type <strong>bag</strong>.</p><p>It is important that the table has a sufficient number of
slots for the objects. If not, the hash list starts to
grow when <strong>init_table/2</strong> returns, which significantly
slows down access to the table for a period of time. The
minimum number of slots is set by the <strong>open_file/2</strong> option
<strong>min_no_slots</strong> and returned by the <strong>info/2</strong>
item <strong>no_slots</strong>. See also option <strong>min_no_slots</strong> below.</p><p>Argument <strong><span class="anno">Options</span></strong> is a list of <strong>{Key, Val}</strong>
tuples, where the following values are allowed:</p><ul><li> <p><strong>{min_no_slots, no_slots()}</strong> - Specifies the
estimated number of different keys to be stored
in the table. The <strong>open_file/2</strong> option with the same
name is ignored, unless the table is created, in which
case performance can be enhanced by supplying an
estimate when initializing the table.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>{format, Format}</strong> - Specifies the format of the
objects returned by function <strong><span class="anno">InitFun</span></strong>. If
<strong>Format</strong> is <strong>term</strong> (the default),
<strong><span class="anno">InitFun</span></strong> is assumed to return a list of tuples.
If <strong>Format</strong> is <strong>bchunk</strong>, <strong><span class="anno">InitFun</span></strong> is
assumed to return <strong><span class="anno">Data</span></strong> as returned by

it is repaired. The returned reference is to be used as the table
name. This function is most useful for debugging purposes.</p><h3>open_file/2</h3><p>Open a Dets table.</p><p>Opens a table. An empty Dets table is created if no file
exists.</p><p>The atom <strong><span class="anno">Name</span></strong> is the table name. The table
name must be provided in all subsequent operations on the
table. The name can be used by other processes as well, and
many processes can share one table.</p><p>If two processes open the same table by giving the same
name and arguments, the table has two users. If one
user closes the table, it remains open until the second
user closes it.</p><p>Argument <strong><span class="anno">Args</span></strong> is a list of <strong>{Key, Val}</strong>
tuples, where the following values are allowed:</p><ul><li> <p><strong>{access, </strong><a href="#type-access">type-access</a><strong>}</strong> - Existing tables can be
opened in read-only mode. A table that is opened
in read-only mode is not subjected to the automatic file
reparation algorithm if it is later opened after a crash.
Defaults to <strong>read_write</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>{auto_save, </strong><a href="#type-auto_save">type-auto_save</a><strong>}</strong> - The autosave
interval. If the interval is an integer <strong>Time</strong>, the
table is flushed to disk whenever it is not accessed for
<strong>Time</strong> milliseconds. A table that has been flushed
requires no reparation when reopened after an
uncontrolled emulator halt. If the interval is the atom
<strong>infinity</strong>, autosave is disabled. Defaults to
180000 (3 minutes).</p> </li><li> <p><strong>{estimated_no_objects, </strong><a href="#type-no_slots">type-no_slots</a><strong>}</strong> - Equivalent to option
<strong>min_no_slots</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>{file, </strong><a href="./file#type-name">file#type-name</a><strong>}</strong> - The name of the file to be
opened. Defaults to the table name.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>{max_no_slots, </strong><a href="#type-no_slots">type-no_slots</a><strong>}</strong> - The maximum number
of slots to be used. Defaults to 32 M, which is the
maximal value. Notice that a higher value can
increase the table fragmentation, and
a smaller value can decrease the fragmentation, at
the expense of execution time.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>{min_no_slots, </strong><a href="#type-no_slots">type-no_slots</a><strong>}</strong> - Application
performance can be enhanced with this flag by specifying,
when the table is created, the estimated number of
different keys to be stored in the table. Defaults to 256,
which is the minimum value.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>{keypos, </strong><a href="#type-keypos">type-keypos</a><strong>}</strong> - The position of the
element of each object to be used as key. Defaults to 1.
The ability to explicitly state the key
position is most convenient when we want to store Erlang
records in which the first position of the record is the
name of the record type.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>{ram_file, boolean()}</strong> - Whether the table is to
be kept in RAM. Keeping the table in RAM can sound like an
anomaly, but can enhance the performance of applications
that open a table, insert a set of objects, and then
close the table. When the table is closed, its contents
are written to the disk file. Defaults to <strong>false</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>{repair, Value}</strong> - <strong>Value</strong> can be either
a <strong>boolean()</strong> or the atom <strong>force</strong>. The flag
specifies if the Dets server is to invoke the
automatic file reparation algorithm. Defaults to
<strong>true</strong>. If <strong>false</strong> is specified, no attempt is
made to repair the file, and <strong>{error, {needs_repair, FileName}}</strong> is returned if the table must be repaired.</p> <p>Value <strong>force</strong> means that a reparation
is made even if the table is properly closed.
This is a seldom needed option.</p> <p>Option <strong>repair</strong> is ignored if the table is already open.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>{type, </strong><a href="#type-type">type-type</a><strong>}</strong> - The table type. Defaults to
<strong>set</strong>.</p> </li></ul><h3>pid2name/1</h3><p>Return the name of the Dets table handled by a pid.</p><p>Returns the table name given the pid of a process
that handles requests to a table, or <strong>undefined</strong> if
there is no such table.</p><p>This function is meant to be used for debugging only.</p><h3>repair_continuation/2</h3><p>Repair a continuation from <strong>select/1</strong> or <strong>select/3</strong>. </p><p>This function can be used to restore an opaque continuation
returned by
<a href="#select/3">select/3</a> or
<a href="#select/1">select/1</a> if the
continuation has passed through external term format (been
sent between nodes or stored on disk).</p><p>The reason for this function is that continuation terms
contain compiled match specifications and therefore are
invalidated if converted to external term format. Given that
the original match specification is kept intact, the
continuation can be restored, meaning it can once again be
used in subsequent <strong>select/1</strong> calls even though it has
been stored on disk or on another node.</p><p>For more information and examples, see the
<a href="ets">ets</a> module.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>This function is rarely needed in application code. It is used by
application Mnesia to provide distributed <strong>select/3</strong>
and <strong>select/1</strong> sequences. A normal application would
either use Mnesia or keep the continuation from being
converted to external format.</p><p>The reason for not having an external representation of
compiled match specifications is performance. It can be
subject to change in future releases, while this interface
remains for backward compatibility.</p></div><h3>safe_fixtable/2</h3><p>Fix a Dets table for safe traversal.</p><p>If <strong><span class="anno">Fix</span></strong> is <strong>true</strong>, table
<strong><span class="anno">Name</span></strong> is
fixed (once more) by the calling process, otherwise the table
is released. The table is also released when a fixing process
terminates.</p><p>If many processes fix a table, the table remains
fixed until all processes have released it or terminated. A
reference counter is kept on a per process basis, and N
consecutive fixes require N releases to release the table.</p><p>It is not guaranteed that calls to <strong>first/1</strong>,
<strong>next/2</strong>, or select and match functions work as expected
even if the table is fixed; the limited support for
concurrency provided by the
<a href="ets">ets</a> module is not yet
provided by Dets.
Fixing a table currently only disables resizing of
the hash list of the table.</p><p>If objects have been added while the table was fixed, the
hash list starts to grow when the table is released, which
significantly slows down access to the table for a period
of time.</p><h3>select/1</h3><p>Apply a match specification to some objects stored in a Dets table.</p><p>Applies a match specification to some objects stored in a
table and returns a non-empty list of the results. The
table, the match specification, and the number of objects
that are matched are all defined by <strong><span class="anno">Continuation</span></strong>,
which is returned by a previous call to
<a href="#select/1">select/1</a> or
<a href="#select/3">select/3</a>.</p><p>When all objects of the table have been matched,
<strong>'$end_of_table'</strong> is returned.</p><h3>select/2</h3><p>Apply a match specification to all objects stored in a Dets table.</p><p>Returns the results of applying match specification
<strong><span class="anno">MatchSpec</span></strong> to all or some objects stored in table
<strong><span class="anno">Name</span></strong>. The order of the objects is not specified.
For a description of match specifications, see the
<a href="./match_spec">ERTS User's Guide</a>.</p><p>If the keypos'th element of <strong><span class="anno">MatchSpec</span></strong> is
unbound, the match specification is applied to all objects of
the table. If the keypos'th element is bound, the match
specification is applied to the objects with the correct key(s)
only.</p><p>Using the <strong>select</strong> functions for traversing all
objects of a table is more efficient than calling
<strong>first/1</strong> and <strong>next/2</strong> or <strong>slot/2</strong>.
</p><h3>select/3</h3><p>Apply a match specification to the first chunk of objects stored in a Dets table.</p><p>Returns the results of applying match specification
<strong><span class="anno">MatchSpec</span></strong> to some or all objects stored in table
<strong><span class="anno">Name</span></strong>. The order of the objects is not specified.
For a description of match specifications, see the
<a href="./match_spec">ERTS User's Guide</a>.</p><p>A tuple of the results of applying the match specification
and a continuation is returned, unless the table is empty,
in which case <strong>'$end_of_table'</strong> is returned. The
continuation is to be used when matching more objects by calling
<a href="#select/1">select/1</a>.</p><p>If the keypos'th element of <strong><span class="anno">MatchSpec</span></strong> is bound,
the  match specification is applied to all objects of the table
with the correct key(s). If the keypos'th element of
<strong><span class="anno">MatchSpec</span></strong> is unbound, the match specification is
applied to all objects of the table, <strong><span class="anno">N</span></strong> objects at
a time, until at least one object matches or the end of the
table is reached. The default, indicated by giving
<strong><span class="anno">N</span></strong> the value <strong>default</strong>, is to let the number
of objects vary depending on the sizes of the objects. All
objects with the
same key are always handled at the same time, which implies that the
match specification can be applied to more than <span class="anno">N</span>
objects.</p><p>The table is always to be protected using
<a href="#safe_fixtable/2">safe_fixtable/2</a>
before calling <strong>select/3</strong>, otherwise
errors can occur when calling <strong>select/1</strong>.</p><h3>select_delete/2</h3><p>Delete all objects that match a given pattern from a Dets table.</p><p>Deletes each object from table <strong><span class="anno">Name</span></strong> such that
applying match specification <strong><span class="anno">MatchSpec</span></strong> to the
object returns value <strong>true</strong>.
For a description of match specifications, see the
<a href="./match_spec">ERTS User's Guide</a>.
Returns the number of deleted objects.</p><p>If the keypos'th element of <strong><span class="anno">MatchSpec</span></strong> is
bound, the match specification is applied to the objects
with the correct key(s) only.</p><h3>slot/2</h3><p>Return the list of objects associated with a slot of a Dets table.</p><p>The objects of a table are distributed among slots,
starting with slot <strong>0</strong> and ending with slot <strong>n</strong>.
Returns the list of objects associated with slot
<strong><span class="anno">I</span></strong>. If <strong><span class="anno">I</span></strong> &gt; <strong>n</strong>,
<strong>'$end_of_table'</strong> is returned.</p><h3>sync/1</h3><p>Ensure that all updates made to a Dets table are written to disk.</p><p>Ensures that all updates made to table <strong><span class="anno">Name</span></strong> are
written to disk. This also applies to tables that have been
opened with flag <strong>ram_file</strong> set to <strong>true</strong>. In
this case, the contents of the RAM file are flushed to disk.</p><p>Notice that the space management data structures kept in RAM,
the buddy system, is also written to the disk. This can take
some time if the table is fragmented.</p><h3>table/1</h3><h3>table/2</h3><p>Return a QLC query handle.</p><p>Returns a Query List
Comprehension (QLC) query handle. The
<a href="qlc">qlc</a> module
provides a query language aimed mainly for Mnesia, but
ETS tables, Dets tables, and lists are also recognized
by <strong>qlc</strong> as sources of data. Calling
<a href="./dets#table/1">dets#table/1</a> is the
means to make Dets table <strong><span class="anno">Name</span></strong> usable to
<strong>qlc</strong>.</p><p>When there are only simple restrictions on the key position,
<strong>qlc</strong> uses
<a href="./dets#lookup/2">dets#lookup/2</a>
to look up the keys. When
that is not possible, the whole table is traversed.
Option <strong>traverse</strong> determines how this is done:</p><ul><li> <p><strong>first_next</strong> - The table is traversed one key at
a time by calling <strong>dets:first/1</strong> and <strong>dets:next/2</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>select</strong> - The table is traversed by calling
<a href="./dets#select/3">dets#select/3</a> and
<a href="./dets#select/1">dets#select/1</a>.
Option <strong>n_objects</strong> determines the number of objects
returned (the third argument of <strong>select/3</strong>). The
match specification (the second argument of
<strong>select/3</strong>) is assembled by <strong>qlc</strong>:</p> <ul><li> <p>Simple filters are translated into equivalent match
specifications.</p> </li><li> <p>More complicated filters must be applied to all
objects returned by <strong>select/3</strong> given a match
specification that matches all objects.</p> </li></ul> </li><li> <p><strong>{select, </strong><a href="#type-match_spec"> match_spec()</a><strong>}</strong> - As for <strong>select</strong>,
the table is traversed by calling <strong>dets:select/3</strong>
and <strong>dets:select/1</strong>. The difference is that the
match specification is specified explicitly. This is how to
state match specifications that cannot easily be
expressed within the syntax provided by <strong>qlc</strong>.</p> </li></ul><p>The following example uses an explicit match specification
to traverse the table:</p><pre>
1&gt; <span class="input">dets:open_file(t, []),</span>
<span class="input">ok = dets:insert(t, [{1,a},{2,b},{3,c},{4,d}]),</span>
<span class="input">MS = ets:fun2ms(fun({X,Y}) when (X &gt; 1) or (X &lt; 5) -&gt; {Y} end),</span>
<span class="input">QH1 = dets:table(t, [{traverse, {select, MS}}]).</span></pre><p>An example with implicit match specification:</p><pre>
2&gt; <span class="input">QH2 = qlc:q([{Y} || {X,Y} &lt;- dets:table(t), (X &gt; 1) or (X &lt; 5)]).</span></pre><p>The latter example is equivalent to the former, which 
can be verified using function <strong>qlc:info/1</strong>:</p><pre>
3&gt; <span class="input">qlc:info(QH1) =:= qlc:info(QH2).</span>
true</pre><p><strong>qlc:info/1</strong> returns information about a query handle.
In this case identical information is returned for the
two query handles.</p><h3>to_ets/2</h3><p>Insert all objects of a Dets table into an ETS table.</p><p>Inserts the objects of the Dets table <strong><span class="anno">Name</span></strong>
into the ETS table <strong><span class="anno">EtsTab</span></strong>. The order in
which the objects are
inserted is not specified. The existing objects of the ETS
table are kept unless overwritten.</p><h3>traverse/2</h3><p>Apply a function to all or some objects stored in a Dets table.</p><p>Applies <strong><span class="anno">Fun</span></strong> to each object stored in table
<strong><span class="anno">Name</span></strong> in some unspecified order. Different
actions are
taken depending on the return value of <strong><span class="anno">Fun</span></strong>. The
following <strong><span class="anno">Fun</span></strong> return values are allowed:</p><dl><dt><strong>continue</strong></dt><dd> <p>Continue to perform the traversal. For example, the
following function can be used to print the contents
of a table:</p> <pre>
fun(X) -&gt; io:format("~p~n", [X]), continue end.</pre> </dd><dt><strong>{continue, Val}</strong></dt><dd> <p>Continue the traversal and accumulate <strong><span class="anno">Val</span></strong>.
The following function is supplied to collect all
objects of a table in a list:</p> <pre>
fun(X) -&gt; {continue, X} end.</pre> </dd><dt><strong>{done, <span class="anno">Value</span>}</strong></dt><dd> <p>Terminate the traversal and return
<strong>[<span class="anno">Value</span> | Acc]</strong>.</p> </dd></dl><p>Any other value <strong><span class="anno">OtherValue</span></strong> returned by
<strong><span class="anno">Fun</span></strong> terminates the
traversal and is returned immediately.</p><h3>update_counter/3</h3><p>Update a counter object stored in a Dets table. </p><p>Updates the object with key <strong><span class="anno">Key</span></strong> stored in
table <strong><span class="anno">Name</span></strong> of type <strong>set</strong> by adding
<strong><span class="anno">Incr</span></strong> to the
element at the <strong><span class="anno">Pos</span></strong>:th position.
The new counter value
is returned. If no position is specified, the element directly
following the key is updated.</p><p>This functions provides a way of updating a counter,
without having to look up an object, update the object by
incrementing an element, and insert the resulting object into
the table again.</p><h3>See Also</h3><p><a href="ets">ets</a>,

directed graphs. What makes the graphs provided here
non-proper directed graphs is that multiple edges between
vertices are allowed. However, the customary definition of
directed graphs is used here.<ul><li> <p>A <a name="digraph"></a><em>directed graph</em> (or just
"digraph") is a pair (V,Â E) of a finite set V of
<a name="vertex"></a><em>vertices</em> and a finite set E of
<a name="edge"></a><em>directed edges</em> (or just "edges").
The set of edges E is a subset of VÂ ÃÂ V (the
Cartesian product of V with itself).</p> <p>In this module, V is allowed to be empty. The so obtained unique
digraph is called the
<a name="empty_digraph"></a><em>empty digraph</em>. Both
vertices and edges are represented by unique Erlang terms.</p> </li><li> <p>Digraphs can be annotated with more information. Such information
can be attached to the vertices and to the edges of the digraph. An
annotated digraph is called a <em>labeled digraph</em>, and the
information attached to a vertex or an edge is called a
<a name="label"></a><em>label</em>. Labels are Erlang
terms.</p> </li><li> <p>An edge eÂ =Â (v,Â w) is said to
<a name="emanate"></a><em>emanate</em> from vertex v and to
be <a name="incident"></a><em>incident</em> on vertex w.</p> </li><li> <p>The <a name="out_degree"></a><em>out-degree</em> of a vertex
is the number of edges emanating from that vertex.</p> </li><li> <p>The <a name="in_degree"></a><em>in-degree</em> of a vertex 
is the number of edges incident on that vertex.</p> </li><li> <p>If an edge is emanating from v and incident on w, then w is
said to be an <a name="out_neighbour"></a>
<em>out-neighbor</em> of v, and v is said to be an
<a name="in_neighbour"></a><em>in-neighbor</em> of w.</p> </li><li> <p>A <a name="path"></a><em>path</em> P from v[1] to v[k]
in a digraph (V,Â E) is a non-empty sequence
v[1],Â v[2],Â ...,Â v[k] of vertices in V such that
there is an edge (v[i],v[i+1]) in E for
1Â &lt;=Â iÂ &lt;Â k.</p> </li><li> <p>The <a name="length"></a><em>length</em> of path P is
k-1.</p> </li><li> <p>Path P is <a name="simple_path"></a><em>simple</em> if all
vertices are distinct, except that the first and the last vertices
can be the same.</p> </li><li> <p>Path P is a <a name="cycle"></a><em>cycle</em> if the
length of P is not zero and v[1] = v[k].</p> </li><li> <p>A <a name="loop"></a><em>loop</em> is a cycle of length
one.</p> </li><li> <p>A <a name="simple_cycle"></a><em>simple cycle</em> is a path
that is both a cycle and simple.</p> </li><li> <p>An <a name="acyclic_digraph"></a><em>acyclic digraph</em>
is a digraph without cycles.</p> </li></ul></p><h2>Data Types</h2><span class="name">d_type</span><span class="name">d_cyclicity</span><span class="name">d_protection</span><span class="name">graph</span><p>A digraph as returned by

</p><p>This module archives and extract files to and from
a tar file. This module supports reading most common tar formats,
namely v7, STAR, USTAR, and PAX, as well as some of GNU tar's extensions
to the USTAR format (sparse files most notably). It produces tar archives
in USTAR format, unless the files being archived require PAX format due to
restrictions in USTAR (such as unicode metadata, filename length, and more).
As such, <strong>erl_tar</strong> supports tar archives produced by most all modern
tar utilities, and produces tarballs which should be similarly portable.By convention, the name of a tar file is to end in "<strong>.tar</strong>".
To abide to the convention, add "<strong>.tar</strong>" to the name.Tar files can be created in one operation using function
<a href="#create/2">create/2</a> or
<a href="#create/3">create/3</a>.Alternatively, for more control, use functions
<a href="#open/2">open/2</a>,
<a href="#add/3">add/3</a>, and
<a href="#close/1">close/1</a>.To extract all files from a tar file, use function
<a href="#extract/1">extract/1</a>.
To extract only some files or to be able to specify some more options,
use function <a href="#extract/2">extract/2</a>.To return a list of the files in a tar file,
use function <a href="#table/1">table/1</a> or
<a href="#table/2">table/2</a>.
To print a list of files to the Erlang shell,
use function <a href="#t/1">t/1</a> or
<a href="#tt/1">tt/1</a>.To convert an error term returned from one of the functions
above to a readable message, use function
<a href="#format_error/1">format_error/1</a>.</p><h3>Unicode Support</h3><p>If <a href="../kernel/file#native_name_encoding/0">kernel/file#native_name_encoding/0</a>
returns <strong>utf8</strong>, path names are encoded in UTF-8 when
creating tar files, and path names are assumed to be encoded in
UTF-8 when extracting tar files.</p><p>If <a href="../kernel/file#native_name_encoding/0">kernel/file#native_name_encoding/0</a>
returns <strong>latin1</strong>, no translation of path names is done.</p><p>Unicode metadata stored in PAX headers is preserved</p><h3>Other Storage Media</h3><p>The <a href="./ftp">ftp/ftp</a>
module normally accesses the tar file on disk using
the <a href="./file">kernel/file</a> module.
When other needs arise, you can define your own low-level Erlang
functions to perform the writing and reading on the storage media;
use function <a href="#init/3">init/3</a>.</p><p>An example of this is the SFTP support in
<a href="../ssh/ssh_sftp#open_tar/3">ssh/ssh_sftp#open_tar/3</a>. This function opens a tar file
on a remote machine using an SFTP channel.</p><h3>Limitations</h3><ul><li> <p>If you must remain compatible with the USTAR tar format, you must ensure file paths being
stored are less than 255 bytes in total, with a maximum filename component
length of 100 bytes. USTAR uses a header field (prefix) in addition to the name field, and
splits file paths longer than 100 bytes into two parts. This split is done on a directory boundary,
and is done in such a way to make the best use of the space available in those two fields, but in practice
this will often mean that you have less than 255 bytes for a path. <strong>erl_tar</strong> will
automatically upgrade the format to PAX to handle longer filenames, so this is only an issue if you
need to extract the archive with an older implementation of <strong>erl_tar</strong> or <strong>tar</strong> which does
not support PAX. In this case, the PAX headers will be extracted as regular files, and you will need to
apply them manually.</p> </li><li> <p>Like the above, if you must remain USTAR compatible, you must also ensure than paths for
symbolic/hard links are no more than 100 bytes, otherwise PAX headers will be used.</p> </li></ul><h2>Functions</h2><h3>add(TarDescriptor, Filename, Options) -&gt; RetValue</h3><p>Add a file to an open tar file.</p><ul><li><span class="v">TarDescriptor = term()</span></li><li><span class="v">FilenameOrBin = filename()|binary()</span></li><li><span class="v">NameInArchive = filename()</span></li><li><span class="v">Filename = filename()|{NameInArchive,FilenameOrBin}</span></li><li><span class="v">Options = [Option]</span></li><li><span class="v">Option = dereference|verbose|{chunks,ChunkSize}</span></li><li><span class="v">|{atime,non_neg_integer()}|{mtime,non_neg_integer()}</span></li><li><span class="v">|{ctime,non_neg_integer()}|{uid,non_neg_integer()}</span></li><li><span class="v">|{gid,non_neg_integer()}</span></li><li><span class="v">ChunkSize = positive_integer()</span></li><li><span class="v">RetValue = ok|{error,{Filename,Reason}}</span></li><li><span class="v">Reason = term()</span></li></ul><p>Adds a file to a tar file that has been opened for writing by

<strong>Name</strong> to the Erlang shell (similar to "<strong>tarÂ tv</strong>").</p><h2>ets</h2><p>Built-in term storage.</p><p>This module is an interface to the Erlang built-in term storage
BIFs. These provide the ability to store very large quantities of
data in an Erlang runtime system, and to have constant access
time to the data. (In the case of <strong>ordered_set</strong>, see below,
access time is proportional to the logarithm of the number of
stored objects.)Data is organized as a set of dynamic tables, which can store
tuples. Each table is created by a process. When the process
terminates, the table is automatically destroyed. Every table has
access rights set at creation.Tables are divided into four different types, <strong>set</strong>,
<strong>ordered_set</strong>, <strong>bag</strong>, and <strong>duplicate_bag</strong>.
A <strong>set</strong> or <strong>ordered_set</strong> table can only have one object
associated with each key. A <strong>bag</strong> or <strong>duplicate_bag</strong> table can
have many objects associated with each key.<a name="max_ets_tables"></a>Notice that there is no automatic garbage collection for tables.
Even if there are no references to a table from any process, it
is not automatically destroyed unless the owner process
terminates. To destroy a table explicitly, use function
<a href="#delete/1">delete/1</a>.
The default owner is the process that created the
table. To transfer table ownership at process termination, use
option <a href="#heir">heir</a> or call
<a href="#give_away/3">give_away/3</a>.Some implementation details:<ul><li><p>In the current implementation, every object insert and
look-up operation results in a copy of the object.</p></li><li><p><strong>'$end_of_table'</strong> is not to be used as a key, as
this atom is used to mark the end of the table when using functions
<a href="#first/1">first/1</a> and
<a href="#next/2">next/2</a>.</p></li></ul>Notice the subtle difference between
<em>matching</em> and <em>comparing equal</em>, which is
demonstrated by table types <strong>set</strong> and <strong>ordered_set</strong>:<ul><li> <p>Two Erlang terms <strong>match</strong> if they are of
the same type and have the same value, so that <strong>1</strong> matches
<strong>1</strong>, but not <strong>1.0</strong> (as <strong>1.0</strong> is a <strong>float()</strong>
and not an <strong>integer()</strong>).</p> </li><li> <p>Two Erlang terms <em>compare equal</em>
if they either are of the same type and value, or if
both are numeric types and extend to the same value, so that
<strong>1</strong> compares equal to both <strong>1</strong> and <strong>1.0</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p>The <strong>ordered_set</strong> works on the <em>Erlang term order</em> and
no defined order exists between an <strong>integer()</strong> and a
<strong>float()</strong> that extends to the same value. Hence the key
<strong>1</strong> and the key <strong>1.0</strong> are regarded as equal in an
<strong>ordered_set</strong> table.</p> </li></ul></p><h3>Failure</h3><p>The functions in this module exits with reason
<strong>badarg</strong> if any argument has the wrong format, if the
table identifier is invalid, or if the operation is denied because of
table access rights (<a href="#protected">protected</a>
or <a href="#private">private</a>).</p><a name="concurrency"></a><h3>Concurrency</h3><p>This module provides some limited support for concurrent access.
All updates to single objects are guaranteed to be both <em>atomic</em>
and <em>isolated</em>. This means that an updating operation to
a single object either succeeds or fails completely without any
effect (atomicity) and that
no intermediate results of the update can be seen by other
processes (isolation). Some functions that update many objects
state that they even guarantee atomicity and isolation for the entire
operation. In database terms the isolation level can be seen as
"serializable", as if all isolated operations are carried out serially,
one after the other in a strict order.</p><a name="traversal"></a><h3>Table traversal</h3><p>There are different ways to traverse through the objects of a table.</p><ul><li><p><em>Single-step</em> traversal one key at at time, using
<a href="#first/1">first/1</a>,
<a href="#next/2">next/2</a>,
<a href="#last/1">last/1</a> and
<a href="#prev/2">prev/2</a>.</p> </li><li><p>Search with simple <em>match patterns</em>, using
<a href="#match/1">match/1</a>,
<a href="#match_delete/2">match_delete/2</a> and
<a href="#match_object/1">match_object/1</a>.</p> </li><li><p>Search with more powerful <em>match specifications</em>, using
<a href="#select/1">select/1</a>,
<a href="#select_count/2">select_count/2</a>,
<a href="#select_delete/2">select_delete/2</a>,
<a href="#select_replace/2">select_replace/2</a> and
<a href="#select_reverse/1">select_reverse/1</a>.</p> </li><li><p><em>Table conversions</em>, using
<a href="#tab2file/2">tab2file/2</a> and
<a href="#tab2list/1">tab2list/1</a>.</p> </li></ul><p>None of these ways of table traversal will guarantee a consistent table snapshot
if the table is also updated during the traversal. Moreover, traversals not
done in a <em>safe</em> way, on tables where keys are inserted or deleted
during the traversal, may yield the following undesired effects:</p><ul><li><p>Any key may be missed.</p></li><li><p>Any key may be found more than once.</p></li><li><p>The traversal may fail with <strong>badarg</strong> exception if keys are deleted.</p> </li></ul><p>A table traversal is <em>safe</em> if either</p><ul><li><p>the table is of type <strong>ordered_set</strong>.</p> </li><li><p>the entire table traversal is done within one ETS function
call.</p> </li><li><p>function <a href="#safe_fixtable/2">safe_fixtable/2</a>
is used to keep the table fixated during the entire traversal.</p> </li></ul><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>Even though the access of a single object is always guaranteed to be
<a href="#concurrency">atomic and isolated</a>, each traversal
through a table to find the next key is not done with such guarantees. This is often
not a problem, but may cause rare subtle "unexpected" effects if a concurrent
process inserts objects during a traversal. For example, consider one
process doing</p><pre>
ets:new(t, [ordered_set, named_table]),
ets:insert(t, {1}),
ets:insert(t, {2}),
ets:insert(t, {3}),
</pre><p>A concurrent call to <strong>ets:first(t)</strong>, done by another
process, may then in rare cases return <strong>2</strong> even though
<strong>2</strong> has never existed in the table ordered as the first key. In
the same way, a concurrent call to <strong>ets:next(t, 1)</strong> may return
<strong>3</strong> even though <strong>3</strong> never existed in the table
ordered directly after <strong>1</strong>.</p><p>Effects like this are improbable but possible. The probability will
further be reduced (if not vanish) if table option
<a href="#new_2_write_concurrency">new_2_write_concurrency</a>
is not enabled. This can also only be a potential concern for
<strong>ordered_set</strong> where the traversal order is defined.</p></div><p>Traversals using <strong>match</strong> and <strong>select</strong> functions may not need to
scan the entire table depending on how the key is specified. A match
pattern with a <em>fully bound key</em> (without any match variables) will
optimize the operation to a single key lookup without any table traversal
at all. For <strong>ordered_set</strong> a <em>partially bound key</em> will limit the
traversal to only scan a subset of the table based on term order. A
partially bound key is either a list or a tuple with a prefix that is fully
bound. Example:</p><pre>
1&gt; <span class="input">T = ets:new(t,[ordered_set]), ets:insert(T, {"555-1234", "John Smith"}).</span>
true
2&gt; <span class="input">%% Efficient search of all with area code 555</span>
2&gt; <span class="input">ets:match(T,{[$5,$5,$5,$- |'$1'],'$2'}).</span>
[["1234","John Smith"]]

<strong>match_spec</strong>. For a brief explanation, see
<a href="#select/2">select/2</a>. For a detailed

specified by their names, unnamed tables are specified by their
table identifiers.</p><p>There is no guarantee of consistency in the returned list. Tables
created or deleted by other processes "during" the <strong>ets:all()</strong>
call either are or are not included in the list. Only tables
created/deleted <em>before</em> <strong>ets:all()</strong> is called are
guaranteed to be included/excluded.</p><h3>delete/1</h3><p>Delete an entire ETS table.</p><p>Deletes the entire table <strong><span class="anno">Tab</span></strong>.</p><h3>delete/2</h3><p>Delete all objects with a specified key from an ETS table.</p><p>Deletes all objects with key <strong><span class="anno">Key</span></strong> from table
<strong><span class="anno">Tab</span></strong>.</p><h3>delete_all_objects/1</h3><p>Delete all objects in an ETS table.</p><p>Delete all objects in the ETS table <strong><span class="anno">Tab</span></strong>.
The operation is guaranteed to be
<a href="#concurrency">atomic and isolated</a>.</p><h3>delete_object/2</h3><p>Deletes a specific from an ETS table.</p><p>Delete the exact object <strong><span class="anno">Object</span></strong> from the
ETS table,
leaving objects with the same key but other differences
(useful for type <strong>bag</strong>). In a <strong>duplicate_bag</strong> table, all
instances of the object are deleted.</p><h3>file2tab/1</h3><p>Read an ETS table from a file.</p><p>Reads a file produced by <a href="#tab2file/2">tab2file/2</a> or 
<a href="#tab2file/3">tab2file/3</a> and
creates the corresponding table <strong><span class="anno">Tab</span></strong>.</p><p>Equivalent to <strong>file2tab(<span class="anno">Filename</span>, [])</strong>.</p><h3>file2tab/2</h3><p>Read an ETS table from a file.</p><p>Reads a file produced by <a href="#tab2file/2">tab2file/2</a> or <a href="#tab2file/3">tab2file/3</a> and creates the
corresponding table <strong><span class="anno">Tab</span></strong>.</p><p>The only supported option is <strong>{verify,boolean()}</strong>.
If verification is turned on (by specifying <strong>{verify,true}</strong>),
the function uses whatever information is present in the file to
assert that the information is not damaged. How this is done depends
on which <strong>extended_info</strong> was written using 
<a href="#tab2file/3">tab2file/3</a>.</p><p>If no <strong>extended_info</strong> is present in the file and
<strong>{verify,true}</strong> is specified, the number of objects
written is compared to the size of the original table when the
dump was started. This can make verification fail if the table was
<strong>public</strong> and objects were added or removed while the
table was dumped to file. To avoid this problem,
either do not verify files dumped while updated simultaneously
or use option <strong>{extended_info, [object_count]}</strong> to
<a href="#tab2file/3">tab2file/3</a>, which
extends the information in the file with the number of objects
written.</p><p>If verification is turned on and the file was written with
option <strong>{extended_info, [md5sum]}</strong>, reading the file
is slower and consumes radically more CPU time than otherwise.</p><p><strong>{verify,false}</strong> is the default.</p><h3>first/1</h3><p>Return the first key in an ETS table.</p><p>Returns the first key <strong><span class="anno">Key</span></strong> in table
<strong><span class="anno">Tab</span></strong>. For an <strong>ordered_set</strong> table, the first
key in Erlang term order is returned. For other
table types, the first key according to the internal
order of the table is returned. If the table is empty,
<strong>'$end_of_table'</strong> is returned.</p><p>To find subsequent keys in the table, use
<a href="#next/2">next/2</a>.</p><h3>foldl/3</h3><p>Fold a function over an ETS table.</p><p><strong><span class="anno">Acc0</span></strong> is returned if the table is empty.
This function is similar to
<a href="./lists#foldl/3">lists#foldl/3</a>.
The table elements are traversed in an unspecified order, except for
<strong>ordered_set</strong> tables, where they are traversed first to last.</p><p>If <strong><span class="anno">Function</span></strong> inserts objects into the table,
or another
process inserts objects into the table, those objects <em>can</em>
(depending on key ordering) be included in the traversal.</p><h3>foldr/3</h3><p>Fold a function over an ETS table.</p><p><strong><span class="anno">Acc0</span></strong> is returned if the table is empty.
This function is similar to
<a href="./lists#foldr/3">lists#foldr/3</a>.
The table elements are traversed in an unspecified order, except for
<strong>ordered_set</strong> tables, where they are traversed last to first.</p><p>If <strong><span class="anno">Function</span></strong> inserts objects into the table,
or another
process inserts objects into the table, those objects <em>can</em>
(depending on key ordering) be included in the traversal.</p><h3>from_dets/2</h3><p>Fill an ETS table with objects from a Dets table.</p><p>Fills an already created ETS table with the objects in the
already opened Dets table <strong><span class="anno">DetsTab</span></strong>.
Existing objects in the ETS table are kept unless
overwritten.</p><p>If any of the tables does not exist or the Dets table is
not open, a <strong>badarg</strong> exception is raised.</p><h3>fun2ms/1</h3><p>Pseudo function that transforms fun syntax to a match specification.</p><p>Pseudo function that by a <strong>parse_transform</strong> translates
<strong><span class="anno">LiteralFun</span></strong> typed as parameter in the function
call to a
<a href="#match_spec">match specification</a>.
With "literal" is meant that the fun must textually be written
as the parameter of the function, it cannot be held in a
variable that in turn is passed to the function.</p><p>The parse transform is provided in the <strong>ms_transform</strong>
module and the source <em>must</em> include
file <strong>ms_transform.hrl</strong> in STDLIB for this
pseudo function to work. Failing to include the hrl file in
the source results in a runtime error, not a compile
time error. The include file is easiest included by adding line
<strong>-include_lib("stdlib/include/ms_transform.hrl").</strong> to
the source file.</p><p>The fun is very restricted, it can take only a single
parameter (the object to match): a sole variable or a
tuple. It must use the <strong>is_</strong> guard tests.
Language constructs that have no representation in a match
specification (<strong>if</strong>, <strong>case</strong>, <strong>receive</strong>,
and so on) are not allowed.</p><p>The return value is the resulting match specification.</p><p><em>Example:</em></p><pre>
1&gt; <span class="input">ets:fun2ms(fun({M,N}) when N &gt; 3 -&gt; M end).</span>
[{{'$1','$2'},[{'&gt;','$2',3}],['$1']}]</pre><p>Variables from the environment can be imported, so that the
following works:</p><pre>
2&gt; <span class="input">X=3.</span>
3
3&gt; <span class="input">ets:fun2ms(fun({M,N}) when N &gt; X -&gt; M end).</span>
[{{'$1','$2'},[{'&gt;','$2',{const,3}}],['$1']}]</pre><p>The imported variables are replaced by match specification
<strong>const</strong> expressions, which is consistent with the
static scoping for Erlang funs. However, local or global function
calls cannot be in the guard or body of the fun. Calls to built-in
match specification functions is of course allowed:</p><pre>
4&gt; <span class="input">ets:fun2ms(fun({M,N}) when N &gt; X, my_fun(M) -&gt; M end).</span>
Error: fun containing local Erlang function calls
('my_fun' called in guard) cannot be translated into match_spec
{error,transform_error}
5&gt; <span class="input">ets:fun2ms(fun({M,N}) when N &gt; X, is_atom(M) -&gt; M end).</span>
[{{'$1','$2'},[{'&gt;','$2',{const,3}},{is_atom,'$1'}],['$1']}]</pre><p>As shown by the example, the function can be called
from the shell also. The fun must be literally in the call
when used from the shell as well.</p><div class="alert alert-warning"><h4 class="alert-heading">Warning</h4><p>If the <strong>parse_transform</strong> is not applied to a module that
calls this pseudo function, the call fails in runtime
(with a <strong>badarg</strong>). The <strong>ets</strong> module
exports a function with this name, but it is never to
be called except when using the function in the
shell. If the <strong>parse_transform</strong> is properly applied by
including header file <strong>ms_transform.hrl</strong>, compiled
code never calls the function, but the function call is
replaced by a literal match specification.</p></div><p>For more information, see <a href="./ms_transform#top">ms_transform#top</a>.</p><h3>give_away/3</h3><p>Change owner of a table.</p><p>Make process <strong><span class="anno">Pid</span></strong> the new owner of table

objects created by calling the input function
<strong><span class="anno">InitFun</span></strong>,
see below. This function is provided for compatibility with
the <strong>dets</strong> module, it is not more efficient than filling
a table by using
<a href="#insert/2">insert/2</a>.</p><p>When called with argument <strong>read</strong>, the function
<strong><span class="anno">InitFun</span></strong> is assumed to return
<strong>end_of_input</strong> when
there is no more input, or <strong>{<span class="anno">Objects</span>, Fun}</strong>, where
<strong><span class="anno">Objects</span></strong> is a list of objects and <strong>Fun</strong> is a
new input function. Any other value <strong>Value</strong> is returned as an
error <strong>{error, {init_fun, Value}}</strong>. Each input function is
called exactly once, and if an error occur, the last
function is called with argument <strong>close</strong>, the reply
of which is ignored.</p><p>If the table type is <strong>set</strong> and more than one object
exists with a given key, one of the objects is
chosen. This is not necessarily the last object with the given
key in the sequence of objects returned by the input
functions. This holds also for duplicated
objects stored in tables of type <strong>bag</strong>.</p><h3>insert/2</h3><p>Insert an object into an ETS table.</p><p>Inserts the object or all of the objects in list

the old object is replaced.</p> </li><li> <p>If the table type is <strong>ordered_set</strong> and the key of the
inserted object <em>compares equal</em> to the key of any object
in the table, the old object is replaced.</p> </li><li> <p>If the list contains more than one object with
<em>matching</em> keys and the table type is <strong>set</strong>, one is
inserted, which one is not defined.
The same holds for table type <strong>ordered_set</strong>
if the keys <em>compare equal</em>.</p> </li></ul><p>The entire operation is guaranteed to be
<a href="#concurrency">atomic and isolated</a>,
even when a list of objects is inserted.</p><h3>insert_new/2</h3><p>Insert an object into an ETS table if the key is not already present.</p><p>Same as <a href="#insert/2">insert/2</a>
except that instead of overwriting objects with the same key
(for <strong>set</strong> or <strong>ordered_set</strong>) or adding more objects with
keys already existing in the table (for <strong>bag</strong> and
<strong>duplicate_bag</strong>), <strong>false</strong> is returned.</p><p>If <strong><span class="anno">ObjectOrObjects</span></strong> is a
list, the function checks <em>every</em> key before
inserting anything. Nothing is inserted unless
<em>all</em> keys present in the list are absent from the
table. Like <strong>insert/2</strong>, the entire operation is guaranteed to be
<a href="#concurrency">atomic and isolated</a>.</p><h3>is_compiled_ms/1</h3><p>Check if an Erlang term is the result of <strong>match_spec_compile</strong>.</p><p>Checks if a term is a valid
compiled <a href="#match_spec">match specification</a>.
The compiled match specification is an opaque datatype that
<em>cannot</em> be sent between Erlang nodes or be stored on
disk. Any attempt to create an external representation of a
compiled match specification results in an empty binary
(<strong>&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;</strong>).</p><p><em>Examples:</em></p><p>The following expression yields <strong>true</strong>::</p><pre><code class="">
ets:is_compiled_ms(ets:match_spec_compile([{'_',[],[true]}])).</code></pre><p>The following expressions yield <strong>false</strong>, as variable
<strong>Broken</strong> contains a compiled match specification that has
passed through external representation:</p><pre><code class="">
MS = ets:match_spec_compile([{'_',[],[true]}]),
Broken = binary_to_term(term_to_binary(MS)),
ets:is_compiled_ms(Broken).</code></pre><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>The reason for not having an external representation of
compiled match specifications is performance. It can be
subject to change in future releases, while this interface
remains for backward compatibility.</p></div><h3>last/1</h3><p>Return the last key in an ETS table of type <strong>ordered_set</strong>.</p><p>Returns the last key <strong><span class="anno">Key</span></strong> according to Erlang
term order in table <strong>Tab</strong> of type <strong>ordered_set</strong>. For
other table types, the function is synonymous to
<a href="#first/1">first/1</a>.
If the table is empty, <strong>'$end_of_table'</strong> is returned.</p><p>To find preceding keys in the table, use
<a href="#prev/2">prev/2</a>.</p><h3>lookup/2</h3><p>Return all objects with a specified key in an ETS table. </p><p>Returns a list of all objects with key <strong><span class="anno">Key</span></strong> in
table <strong><span class="anno">Tab</span></strong>.</p><ul><li> <p>For tables of type <strong>set</strong>, <strong>bag</strong>, or
<strong>duplicate_bag</strong>, an object is returned only if the specified
key <em>matches</em> the key of the object in the table.</p> </li><li> <p>For tables of type <strong>ordered_set</strong>, an object is returned if
the specified key <em>compares equal</em> to the key of an object
in the table.</p> </li></ul><p>The difference is the same as between <strong>=:=</strong> and <strong>==</strong>.</p><p>As an example, one can insert an object with
<strong>integer()</strong> <strong>1</strong> as a key in an <strong>ordered_set</strong>
and get the object returned as a result of doing a <strong>lookup/2</strong>
with <strong>float()</strong> <strong>1.0</strong> as the key to search for.</p><p>For tables of type <strong>set</strong> or <strong>ordered_set</strong>,
the function returns either the empty list or a list with one
element, as there cannot be more than one object with the same
key. For tables of type <strong>bag</strong> or <strong>duplicate_bag</strong>, the
function returns a list of arbitrary length.</p><p>Notice that the time order of object insertions is preserved;
the first object inserted with the specified key is the first
in the resulting list, and so on.</p><p>Insert and lookup times in tables of type <strong>set</strong>,
<strong>bag</strong>, and <strong>duplicate_bag</strong> are constant, regardless
of the table size. For the <strong>ordered_set</strong>
datatype, time is proportional to the (binary) logarithm of
the number of objects.</p><h3>lookup_element/3</h3><p>Return the <strong>Pos</strong>:th element of all objects with a specified key in an ETS table.</p><p>For a table <strong><span class="anno">Tab</span></strong> of type <strong>set</strong> or
<strong>ordered_set</strong>, the function returns the
<strong><span class="anno">Pos</span></strong>:th
element of the object with key <strong><span class="anno">Key</span></strong>.</p><p>For tables of type <strong>bag</strong> or <strong>duplicate_bag</strong>,
the functions returns a list with the <strong><span class="anno">Pos</span></strong>:th
element of every object with key <strong><span class="anno">Key</span></strong>.</p><p>If no object with key <strong><span class="anno">Key</span></strong> exists, the
function exits with reason <strong>badarg</strong>.</p><p>The difference between <strong>set</strong>, <strong>bag</strong>, and
<strong>duplicate_bag</strong> on one hand, and <strong>ordered_set</strong> on
the other, regarding the fact that <strong>ordered_set</strong>
view keys as equal when they <em>compare equal</em>
whereas the other table types regard them equal only when
they <em>match</em>, holds for <strong>lookup_element/3</strong>.</p><h3>match/1</h3><p>Continues matching objects in an ETS table.</p><p>Continues a match started with
<a href="#match/3">match/3</a>. The next
chunk of the size specified in the initial <strong>match/3</strong>
call is returned together with a new <strong><span class="anno">Continuation</span></strong>,
which can be used in subsequent calls to this function.</p><p>When there are no more objects in the table, <strong>'$end_of_table'</strong>
is returned.</p><h3>match/2</h3><p>Match the objects in an ETS table against a pattern. </p><p>Matches the objects in table <strong><span class="anno">Tab</span></strong> against
pattern <strong><span class="anno">Pattern</span></strong>.</p><p>A pattern is a term that can contain:</p><ul><li>Bound parts (Erlang terms)</li><li><strong>'_'</strong> that matches any Erlang term</li><li>Pattern variables <strong>'$N'</strong>, where <strong>N</strong>=0,1,...</li></ul><p>The function returns a list with one element for each
matching object, where each element is an ordered list of
pattern variable bindings, for example:</p><pre>
6&gt; <span class="input">ets:match(T, '$1').</span> % Matches every object in table
[[{rufsen,dog,7}],[{brunte,horse,5}],[{ludde,dog,5}]]
7&gt; <span class="input">ets:match(T, {'_',dog,'$1'}).</span>
[[7],[5]]
8&gt; <span class="input">ets:match(T, {'_',cow,'$1'}).</span>
[]</pre><p>If the key is specified in the pattern, the match is very
efficient. If the key is not specified, that is, if it is a
variable or an underscore, the entire table must be searched.
The search time can be substantial if the table is very large.</p><p>For tables of type <strong>ordered_set</strong>, the result is in
the same order as in a <strong>first</strong>/<strong>next</strong> traversal.</p><h3>match/3</h3><p>Match the objects in an ETS table against a pattern and return part of the answers.</p><p>Works like <a href="#match/2">match/2</a>, 
but returns only a limited (<strong><span class="anno">Limit</span></strong>) number of
matching objects. Term <strong><span class="anno">Continuation</span></strong> can then
be used in subsequent calls to <a href="#match/1">match/1</a> to get the next chunk of matching
objects. This is a space-efficient way to work on objects in a
table, which is faster than traversing the table object
by object using
<a href="#first/1">first/1</a> and
<a href="#next/2">next/2</a>.</p><p>If the table is empty, <strong>'$end_of_table'</strong> is returned.</p><p>Use <a href="#safe_fixtable/2">safe_fixtable/2</a>
to guarantee <a href="#traversal">safe traversal</a>
for subsequent calls to <a href="#match/1">match/1</a>.</p><h3>match_delete/2</h3><p>Delete all objects that match a specified pattern from an ETS table.</p><p>Deletes all objects that match pattern <strong><span class="anno">Pattern</span></strong>
from table <strong><span class="anno">Tab</span></strong>. For a description of patterns,
see <a href="#match/2">match/2</a>.</p><h3>match_object/1</h3><p>Continues matching objects in an ETS table.</p><p>Continues a match started with
<a href="#match_object/3">match_object/3</a>.
The next chunk of the size specified in the initial
<strong>match_object/3</strong> call is returned together with a new
<strong><span class="anno">Continuation</span></strong>, which can be used in subsequent
calls to this function.</p><p>When there are no more objects in the table, <strong>'$end_of_table'</strong>
is returned.</p><h3>match_object/2</h3><p>Match the objects in an ETS table against a pattern. </p><p>Matches the objects in table <strong><span class="anno">Tab</span></strong> against
pattern <strong><span class="anno">Pattern</span></strong>. For a description of patterns,
see <a href="#match/2">match/2</a>.
The function returns a list of all objects that

be restored, meaning it can once again be used in subsequent

is returned.</p><h3>select/2</h3><p>Match the objects in an ETS table against a match specification.</p><p>Matches the objects in table <strong><span class="anno">Tab</span></strong> using a
<a href="#match_spec">match specification</a>.
This is a more general call than
<a href="#match/2">match/2</a> and
<a href="#match_object/2">match_object/2</a>
calls. In its simplest form, the match specification is as
follows:</p><pre><code class="">
MatchSpec = [MatchFunction]
MatchFunction = {MatchHead, [Guard], [Result]}
MatchHead = "Pattern as in ets:match"
Guard = {"Guardtest name", ...}
Result = "Term construct"</code></pre><p>This means that the match specification is always a list of one or
more tuples (of arity 3). The first element of the tuple is to be
a pattern as described in
<a href="#match/2">match/2</a>.
The second element of the tuple is to
be a list of 0 or more guard tests (described below). The
third element of the tuple is to be a list containing a
description of the value to return. In almost all
normal cases, the list contains exactly one term that fully
describes the value to return for each object.</p><p>The return value is constructed using the "match variables"
bound in <strong>MatchHead</strong> or using the special match variables
<strong>'$_'</strong> (the whole matching object) and <strong>'$$'</strong> (all
match variables in a list), so that the following
<strong>match/2</strong> expression:</p><pre><code class="">
ets:match(Tab,{'$1','$2','$3'})</code></pre><p>is exactly equivalent to:</p><pre><code class="">
ets:select(Tab,[{{'$1','$2','$3'},[],['$$']}])</code></pre><p>And that the following <strong>match_object/2</strong> call:</p><pre><code class="">
ets:match_object(Tab,{'$1','$2','$1'})</code></pre><p>is exactly equivalent to</p><pre><code class="">
ets:select(Tab,[{{'$1','$2','$1'},[],['$_']}])</code></pre><p>Composite terms can be constructed in the <strong>Result</strong> part
either by simply writing a list, so that the following code:</p><pre><code class="">
ets:select(Tab,[{{'$1','$2','$3'},[],['$$']}])</code></pre><p>gives the same output as:</p><pre><code class="">
ets:select(Tab,[{{'$1','$2','$3'},[],[['$1','$2','$3']]}])</code></pre><p>That is, all the bound variables in the match head as a list. If
tuples are to be constructed, one has to write a tuple of
arity 1 where the single element in the tuple is the tuple
one wants to construct (as an ordinary tuple can be mistaken
for a <strong>Guard</strong>).</p><p>Therefore the following call:</p><pre><code class="">
ets:select(Tab,[{{'$1','$2','$1'},[],['$_']}])</code></pre><p>gives the same output as:</p><pre><code class="">
ets:select(Tab,[{{'$1','$2','$1'},[],[{{'$1','$2','$3'}}]}])</code></pre><p>This syntax is equivalent to the syntax used in the trace
patterns (see the
<a href="./dbg">runtime_tools/dbg</a>) module in Runtime_Tools.</p><p>The <strong>Guard</strong>s are constructed as tuples, where the first
element is the test name and the remaining elements
are the test parameters. To check for a specific type
(say a list) of the element bound to the match variable
<strong>'$1'</strong>, one would write the test as
<strong>{is_list, '$1'}</strong>. If the test fails, the object in the
table does not match and the next <strong>MatchFunction</strong> (if
any) is tried. Most guard tests present in Erlang can be
used, but only the new versions prefixed <strong>is_</strong> are
allowed (<strong>is_float</strong>, <strong>is_atom</strong>, and so on).</p><p>The <strong>Guard</strong> section can also contain logic and
arithmetic operations, which are written with the same syntax
as the guard tests (prefix notation), so that the following
guard test written in Erlang:</p><pre><code class="">
is_integer(X), is_integer(Y), X + Y &lt; 4711</code></pre><p>is expressed as follows (<strong>X</strong> replaced with <strong>'$1'</strong> and
<strong>Y</strong> with <strong>'$2'</strong>):</p><pre><code class="">
[{is_integer, '$1'}, {is_integer, '$2'}, {'&lt;', {'+', '$1', '$2'}, 4711}]</code></pre><p>For tables of type <strong>ordered_set</strong>, objects are visited
in the same order as in a <strong>first</strong>/<strong>next</strong>
traversal. This means that the match specification is
executed against objects with keys in the <strong>first</strong>/<strong>next</strong>
order and the corresponding result list is in the order of that
execution.</p><h3>select/3</h3><p>Match the objects in an ETS table against a match specification and return part of the answers.</p><p>Works like <a href="#select/2">select/2</a>,

Comprehension (QLC) query handle. The
<a href="qlc">qlc</a> module provides
a query language aimed mainly at Mnesia, but ETS
tables, Dets tables,
and lists are also recognized by QLC as sources of
data. Calling <strong>table/1,2</strong> is the means to make the
ETS table <strong>Tab</strong> usable to QLC.</p><p>When there are only simple restrictions on the key position,
QLC uses <a href="#lookup/2">lookup/2</a>
to look up the keys. When
that is not possible, the whole table is traversed.
Option <strong>traverse</strong> determines how this is done:</p><dl><dt><strong>first_next</strong></dt><dd> <p>The table is traversed one key at a time by calling
<a href="#first/1">first/1</a> and
<a href="#next/2">next/2</a>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>last_prev</strong></dt><dd> <p>The table is traversed one key at a time by calling
<a href="#last/1">last/1</a> and

<a href="#select/3">select/3</a> and
<a href="#select/1">select/1</a>.
Option <strong>n_objects</strong> determines the number of objects
returned (the third argument of <strong>select/3</strong>); the
default is to return <strong>100</strong> objects at a time. The
<a href="#match_spec">match specification</a> (the
second argument of <strong>select/3</strong>) is assembled by QLC: simple
filters are translated into equivalent match specifications
while more complicated filters must be applied to all
objects returned by <strong>select/3</strong> given a match specification
that matches all objects.</p> </dd><dt><strong>{select, <span class="anno">MatchSpec</span>}</strong></dt><dd> <p>As for <strong>select</strong>, the table is traversed by calling
<a href="#select/3">select/3</a> and
<a href="#select/1">select/1</a>.
The difference is that the match specification is explicitly
specified. This is how to state match specifications that cannot
easily be expressed within the syntax provided by QLC.</p> </dd></dl><p><em>Examples:</em></p><p>An explicit match specification is here used to traverse the

10&gt; <span class="input">QH2 = qlc:q([{Y} || {X,Y} &lt;- ets:table(Tab), (X &gt; 1) or (X &lt; 5)]).</span></pre><p>The latter example is equivalent to the former, which

<strong><span class="anno">Key</span></strong> in table <strong><span class="anno">Tab</span></strong>.</p><p>The specified <strong><span class="anno">Key</span></strong> is used to identify the object

The function both tests <strong><span class="anno">MatchSpec</span></strong> for "syntactic"
correctness and runs the match specification against object
<strong><span class="anno">Tuple</span></strong>.</p><p>If the match specification is syntactically correct, the function
either returns <strong>{ok,<span class="anno">Result</span>}</strong>, where
<strong><span class="anno">Result</span></strong> is what would have been the result in a
real <strong>select/2</strong> call, or <strong>false</strong> if the match specification
does not match object <strong><span class="anno">Tuple</span></strong>.</p><p>If the match specification contains errors, tuple
<strong>{error, <span class="anno">Errors</span>}</strong> is returned,
where <strong><span class="anno">Errors</span></strong> is a list of natural language

already sorted files, and checking files for sortedness. Chunks
containing binary terms are read from a sequence of files, sorted
internally in memory and written on temporary files, which are
merged producing one sorted file as output. Merging is provided
as an optimization; it is faster when the files are already
sorted, but it always works to sort instead of merge.On a file, a term is represented by a header and a binary. Two
options define the format of terms on files:<dl><dt><strong>{header, HeaderLength}</strong></dt><dd> <p><strong>HeaderLength</strong> determines the
number of bytes preceding each binary and containing the
length of the binary in bytes. Defaults to 4. The order of the
header bytes is defined as follows: if <strong>B</strong> is a binary
containing a header only, size <strong>Size</strong> of the binary
is calculated as
<strong>&lt;&lt;Size:HeaderLength/unit:8&gt;&gt; = B</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>{format, Format}</strong></dt><dd> <p>Option <strong>Format</strong> determines the
function that is applied to binaries to create the
terms to be sorted. Defaults to
<strong>binary_term</strong>, which is equivalent to
<strong>funÂ binary_to_term/1</strong>. Value <strong>binary</strong> is
equivalent to <strong>fun(X) -&gt; X end</strong>, which means that the
binaries are sorted as they are. This is the fastest
format. If <strong>Format</strong> is <strong>term</strong>, <strong>io:read/2</strong> is
called to read terms. In that case, only the default value of
option <strong>header</strong> is allowed.</p> <p>Option <strong>format</strong> also determines what is written to the
sorted output file: if
<strong>Format</strong> is <strong>term</strong>, then <strong>io:format/3</strong> is called
to write each term, otherwise the binary prefixed by a header
is written. Notice that the binary written is the same binary
that was read; the results of applying function <strong>Format</strong>
are thrown away when the terms have been sorted.
Reading and writing terms using the <strong>io</strong> module
is much slower than reading and writing binaries.</p> </dd></dl>Other options are:<dl><dt><strong>{order, Order}</strong></dt><dd> <p>The default is to sort terms in
ascending order, but that can be changed by value
<strong>descending</strong> or by specifying an ordering function <strong>Fun</strong>.
An ordering function is antisymmetric, transitive, and total.
<strong>Fun(A,Â B)</strong> is to return <strong>true</strong> if <strong>A</strong>
comes before <strong>B</strong> in the ordering, otherwise <strong>false</strong>.
An example of a typical ordering function is less than or equal
to, <strong>=&lt;/2</strong>. Using an ordering function slows down the sort
considerably. Functions <strong>keysort</strong>, <strong>keymerge</strong> and
<strong>keycheck</strong> do not accept ordering functions.</p> </dd><dt><strong>{unique, boolean()}</strong></dt><dd> <p>When sorting or merging files,
only the first of a sequence of terms that compare equal (<strong>==</strong>)
is output if this option is set to <strong>true</strong>. Defaults
to <strong>false</strong>, which implies that all terms that
compare equal are output. When checking files for
sortedness, a check that no pair of consecutive terms
compares equal is done if this option is set to <strong>true</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>{tmpdir, TempDirectory}</strong></dt><dd> <p>The directory where
temporary files are put can be chosen explicitly. The
default, implied by value <strong>""</strong>, is to put temporary
files on the same directory as the sorted output file. If
output is a function (see below), the directory returned by
<strong>file:get_cwd()</strong> is used instead. The names of
temporary files are derived from the Erlang nodename
(<strong>node()</strong>), the process identifier of the current Erlang
emulator (<strong>os:getpid()</strong>), and a unique integer
(<strong>erlang:unique_integer([positive])</strong>). A typical name is
<strong>fs_mynode@myhost_1763_4711.17</strong>, where
<strong>17</strong> is a sequence number. Existing files are
overwritten. Temporary files are deleted unless some
uncaught <strong>EXIT</strong> signal occurs.</p> </dd><dt><strong>{compressed, boolean()}</strong></dt><dd> <p>Temporary files and the output file can be compressed. Defaults
<strong>false</strong>, which implies that written files are not
compressed. Regardless of the value of option <strong>compressed</strong>,
compressed files can always be read. Notice that
reading and writing compressed files are significantly slower
than reading and writing uncompressed files.</p> </dd><dt><strong>{size, Size}</strong></dt><dd> <p>By default about 512*1024 bytes read from files are sorted
internally. This option is rarely needed.</p> </dd><dt><strong>{no_files, NoFiles}</strong></dt><dd> <p>By default 16 files are merged at a time. This option is rarely
needed.</p> </dd></dl>As an alternative to sorting files, a function of one argument
can be specified as input. When called with argument <strong>read</strong>,
the function is assumed to return either of the following:<ul><li> <p><strong>end_of_input</strong> or <strong>{end_of_input, Value}}</strong> when there
is no more input (<strong>Value</strong> is explained below).</p> </li><li> <p><strong>{Objects, Fun}</strong>, where <strong>Objects</strong> is a list of binaries
or terms depending on the format, and <strong>Fun</strong> is a new input
function.</p> </li></ul>Any other value is immediately returned as value of the current call
to <strong>sort</strong> or <strong>keysort</strong>. Each input function is
called exactly once. If an error occurs, the last
function is called with argument <strong>close</strong>, the reply of
which is ignored.A function of one argument can be specified as output. The results
of sorting or merging the input is collected in a non-empty
sequence of variable length lists of binaries or terms depending
on the format. The output function is called with one list at a
time, and is assumed to return a new output function. Any other
return value is immediately returned as value of the current
call to the sort or merge function. Each output function is
called exactly once. When some output function has been applied
to all of the results or an error occurs, the last function is
called with argument <strong>close</strong>, and the reply is returned
as value of the current call to the sort or merge function.If a function is specified as input and the last input function
returns <strong>{end_of_input, Value}</strong>, the function specified as output
is called with argument <strong>{value, Value}</strong>. This makes it
easy to initiate the sequence of output functions with a value
calculated by the input functions.As an example, consider sorting the terms on a disk log file.
A function that reads chunks from the disk log and returns a
list of binaries is used as input. The results are collected in
a list of terms.<pre>

    end.</pre>For more examples of functions as input and output, see
the end of the <strong>file_sorter</strong> module; the <strong>term</strong>

</p><p>This module contains utilities on a higher level than the
<a href="./file">kernel/file</a> module.This module does not support "raw" filenames (that is, files whose
names do not comply with the expected encoding). Such files are ignored
by the functions in this module.For more information about raw filenames, see the
<a href="./file">kernel/file</a> module.</p><h2>Data Types</h2><span class="name">filename</span><span class="name">dirname</span><span class="name">dirname_all</span><span class="name">filename_all</span><span class="name">find_file_rule</span><span class="name">find_source_rule</span><h2>Functions</h2><h3>ensure_dir/1</h3><p>Ensure that all parent directories for a file or directory exist.</p><p>Ensures that all parent directories for the specified file or
directory name <strong><span class="anno">Name</span></strong>

or can be created. Returns <strong>{error, <span class="anno">Reason</span>}</strong> if
some parent directory does not exist and cannot be created.</p><h3>file_size/1</h3><p>Return the size in bytes of a file.</p><p>Returns the size of the specified file.</p><h3>fold_files/5</h3><p>Fold over all files matching a regular expression.</p><p>Folds function <strong><span class="anno">Fun</span></strong> over all (regular) files
<strong><span class="anno">F</span></strong> in directory <strong><span class="anno">Dir</span></strong> that match
the regular expression <strong><span class="anno">RegExp</span></strong> (for a description
of the allowed regular expressions,
see the <a href="re">re</a> module).
If <strong><span class="anno">Recursive</span></strong> is <strong>true</strong>, all subdirectories
to <strong>Dir</strong>
are processed. The regular expression matching is only done on
the filename without the directory part.</p><p>If Unicode filename translation is in effect and the file
system is transparent, filenames that cannot be
interpreted as Unicode can be encountered, in which case the
<strong>fun()</strong> must be prepared to handle raw filenames
(that is, binaries). If the regular expression contains
codepoints &gt; 255, it does not match filenames that do
not conform to the expected character encoding (that is, are not
encoded in valid UTF-8).</p><p>For more information about raw filenames, see the
<a href="./file">kernel/file</a> module.</p><h3>is_dir/1</h3><p>Test whether <strong>Name</strong> refers to a directory.</p><p>Returns <strong>true</strong> if <strong><span class="anno">Name</span></strong>

<strong><span class="anno">Wildcard</span></strong>.</p><p>The wildcard string looks like an ordinary filename, except
that the following "wildcard characters" are interpreted in a special
way:</p><dl><dt>?</dt><dd> <p>Matches one character.</p> </dd><dt>*</dt><dd> <p>Matches any number of characters up to the end of
the filename, the next dot, or the next slash.</p> </dd><dt>**</dt><dd> <p>Two adjacent <strong>*</strong> used as a single pattern match
all files and zero or more directories and subdirectories.</p> </dd><dt>[Character1,Character2,...]</dt><dd> <p>Matches any of the characters listed. Two characters
separated by a hyphen match a range of characters.
Example: <strong>[A-Z]</strong> matches any uppercase letter.</p> </dd><dt>{Item,...}</dt><dd> <p>Alternation. Matches one of the alternatives.</p> </dd></dl><p>Other characters represent themselves. Only filenames that
have exactly the same character in the same position match.
Matching is case-sensitive, for example, "a" does not match "A".</p><p>Directory separators must always be written as <strong>/</strong>, even on
Windows.</p><p>A character preceded by <strong>\</strong> loses its special meaning. Note
that <strong>\</strong> must be written as <strong>\\</strong> in a string literal.
For example, "\\?*" will match any filename starting with <strong>?</strong>.</p><p>Notice that multiple "*" characters are allowed
(as in Unix wildcards, but opposed to Windows/DOS wildcards).</p><p><em>Examples:</em></p><p>The following examples assume that the current directory is the
top of an Erlang/OTP installation.</p><p>To find all <strong>.beam</strong> files in all applications, use the
following line:</p><pre><code class="">

directories, use either of the following lines:</p><pre><code class="">

the given directory path. For example, a rule <strong>{"ebin", "src"}</strong>
means that if the directory path ends with <strong>"ebin"</strong>, the
corresponding path ending in <strong>"src"</strong> should be searched.</p><p>If <strong><span class="anno">Rules</span></strong> is left out or is an empty list, the
default system rules are used. See also the Kernel application
parameter <a href="../kernel/kernel_app#source_search_rules">kernel/kernel_app#source_search_rules</a>.</p><h3>find_source/1</h3><p>Find the source file for a given object file.</p><p>Equivalent to <strong>find_source(Base, Dir)</strong>, where <strong>Dir</strong> is
<strong>filename:dirname(<span class="anno">FilePath</span>)</strong> and <strong>Base</strong> is
<strong>filename:basename(<span class="anno">FilePath</span>)</strong>.</p><h3>find_source/2</h3><h3>find_source/3</h3><p>Find a source file relative to a given directory.</p><p>Applies file extension specific rules to find the source file for
a given object file relative to the object directory. For example,
for a file with the extension <strong>.beam</strong>, the default rule is to
look for a file with a corresponding extension <strong>.erl</strong> by
replacing the suffix <strong>"ebin"</strong> of the object directory path with
<strong>"src"</strong> or <strong>"src/*"</strong>.
The file search is done through <a href="#find_file/3">find_file/3</a>. The directory of
the object file is always tried before any other directory specified
by the rules.</p><p>If <strong><span class="anno">Rules</span></strong> is left out or is an empty list, the
default system rules are used. See also the Kernel application
parameter <a href="../kernel/kernel_app#source_search_rules">kernel/kernel_app#source_search_rules</a>.</p><h2>filename</h2><p>Filename manipulation functions.</p><p>This module provides functions
for analyzing and manipulating filenames. These functions are
designed so that the Erlang code can work on many different
platforms with different filename formats. With filename
is meant all strings that can be used to denote a file. The filename
can be a short relative name like <strong>foo.erl</strong>, a long absolute
name including a drive designator, a directory name like
<strong>D:\usr/local\bin\erl/lib\tools\foo.erl</strong>, or any variations
in between.In Windows, all functions return filenames with forward slashes
only, even if the arguments contain backslashes. To normalize a
filename by removing redundant directory separators, use
<a href="#join/1">join/1</a>.
The module supports
<a href="./unicode_usage#notes-about-raw-filenames">raw filenames</a> in the way that if a binary is
present, or the filename cannot be interpreted according to the return
value of <a href="../kernel/file#native_name_encoding/0">kernel/file#native_name_encoding/0</a>, a raw filename is also
returned. For example, <strong>join/1</strong> provided with a path component
that is a binary (and cannot be interpreted under the current
native filename encoding) results in a raw filename that is returned
(the join operation is performed of course). For more information
about raw filenames, see the
<a href="./file">kernel/file</a> module.</p><h2>Functions</h2><h3>absname/1</h3><p>Convert a filename to an absolute name, relative the working directory.</p><p>Converts a relative <strong><span class="anno">Filename</span></strong> and returns an
absolute name. No attempt is made to create the shortest absolute
name, as this can give incorrect results on file systems that
allow links.</p><p><em>Unix examples:</em></p><pre>

relative is specified in argument <strong><span class="anno">Dir</span></strong>.</p><h3>absname_join/2</h3><p>Join an absolute directory with a relative filename.</p><p>Joins an absolute directory with a relative filename. Similar to
<a href="#join/2">join/2</a>, but on platforms
with tight restrictions on raw filename length and no support for
symbolic links (read: VxWorks), leading parent directory components
in <strong><span class="anno">Filename</span></strong> are matched against trailing
directory components in <strong><span class="anno">Dir</span></strong> so they can be
removed from the result - minimizing its length.</p><h3>basedir/2</h3><h3>basedir/2</h3><p>Equivalent to <strong>basedir(<span class="anno">PathType</span>, <span class="anno">Application</span>,#{})</strong> or <strong>basedir(<span class="anno">PathsType</span>, <span class="anno">Application</span>,#{})</strong>. </p><ul><li>PathType</li></ul><ul><li>basedir_path_type</li></ul><ul><li>PathsType</li></ul><ul><li>basedir_paths_type</li></ul><ul><li>Application</li></ul><p>

General Balanced Trees. Ordered sets can be much more efficient than
using ordered lists, for larger sets, but depends on the
application.This module considers two elements as different if and only if
they do not compare equal (<strong>==</strong>).</p><h3>Complexity Note</h3><p>The complexity on set operations is bounded by either <em>O(|S|)</em> or
<em>O(|T| * log(|S|))</em>, where S is the largest given set, depending
on which is fastest for any particular function call. For
operating on sets of almost equal size, this implementation is
about 3 times slower than using ordered-list sets directly. For
sets of very different sizes, however, this solution can be
arbitrarily much faster; in practical cases, often
10-100 times. This implementation is particularly suited for
accumulating elements a few at a time, building up a large set
(&gt; 100-200 elements), and repeatedly testing for
membership in the current set.</p><p>As with normal tree structures, lookup (membership testing),
insertion, and deletion have logarithmic complexity.</p><h3>Compatibility</h3><p>The following functions in this module also exist and provides
the same functionality in the
<a href="sets">sets</a> and
<a href="ordsets">ordsets</a>
modules. That is, by only changing the module name for each call,
you can try out different set representations.</p><ul><li><a href="#add_element/2">add_element/2</a> </li><li><a href="#del_element/2">del_element/2</a> </li><li><a href="#filter/2">filter/2</a> </li><li><a href="#fold/3">fold/3</a> </li><li><a href="#from_list/1">from_list/1</a> </li><li><a href="#intersection/1">intersection/1</a> </li><li><a href="#intersection/2">intersection/2</a> </li><li><a href="#is_element/2">is_element/2</a> </li><li><a href="#is_empty/1">is_empty/1</a> </li><li><a href="#is_set/1">is_set/1</a> </li><li><a href="#is_subset/2">is_subset/2</a> </li><li><a href="#new/0">new/0</a> </li><li><a href="#size/1">size/1</a> </li><li><a href="#subtract/2">subtract/2</a> </li><li><a href="#to_list/1">to_list/1</a> </li><li><a href="#union/1">union/1</a> </li><li><a href="#union/2">union/2</a> </li></ul><h2>Data Types</h2><span class="name">set</span><p>A general balanced set.</p><span class="name">set</span><span class="name">iter</span><p>A general balanced set iterator.</p><span class="name">iter</span><h2>Functions</h2><h3>add/2</h3><h3>add_element/2</h3><p>Add a (possibly existing) element to a set.</p><p>Returns a new set formed from <strong><span class="anno">Set1</span></strong> with

has many callback modules that are added and deleted
dynamically. <strong>gen_event</strong> is therefore more tolerant of callback
module errors than the other behaviors. If a callback function for
an installed event handler fails with <strong>Reason</strong>, or returns a
bad value <strong>Term</strong>, the event manager does not fail. It deletes
the event handler by calling callback function
<a href="#Module:terminate/2">Module:terminate/2</a>,
giving as argument
<strong>{error,{'EXIT',Reason}}</strong> or <strong>{error,Term}</strong>, respectively.
No other event handler is affected.A <strong>gen_event</strong> process handles system messages as described in
<a href="sys">sys</a>. The <strong>sys</strong> module
can be used for debugging an event manager.Notice that an event manager <em>does</em> trap exit signals
automatically.The <strong>gen_event</strong> process can go into hibernation 
(see <a href="../erts/erlang#hibernate/3">erts/erlang#hibernate/3</a>) if a callback function in
a handler module specifies <strong>hibernate</strong> in its return value.
This can be useful if the server is expected to be idle for a long
time. However, use this feature with care, as hibernation
implies at least two garbage collections (when hibernating and
shortly after waking up) and is not something you want to do
between each event handled by a busy event manager.Notice that when multiple event handlers are
invoked, it is sufficient that one single event handler returns a
<strong>hibernate</strong> request for the whole event manager to go into
hibernation.Unless otherwise stated, all functions in this module fail if
the specified event manager does not exist or if bad arguments are
specified.</p><h2>Data Types</h2><span class="name">handler</span><span class="name">handler_args</span><span class="name">add_handler_ret</span><span class="name">del_handler_ret</span><h2>Functions</h2><h3>add_handler(EventMgrRef, Handler, Args) -&gt; Result</h3><p>Add an event handler to a generic event manager.</p><ul><li><span class="v">EventMgrRef = Name | {Name,Node} | {global,GlobalName} | {via,Module,ViaName} | pid()</span></li><li><span class="v">Â Name = Node = atom()</span></li><li><span class="v">Â GlobalName = ViaName = term()</span></li><li><span class="v">Handler = Module | {Module,Id}</span></li><li><span class="v">Â Module = atom()</span></li><li><span class="v">Â Id = term()</span></li><li><span class="v">Args = term()</span></li><li><span class="v">Result = ok | {'EXIT',Reason} | term()</span></li><li><span class="v">Â Reason = term()</span></li></ul><p>Adds a new event handler to event manager <strong>EventMgrRef</strong>.

    </code></pre><h2>gen_server</h2><p>Generic server behavior.</p><p>This behavior module provides the server of a client-server
relation. A generic server process (<strong>gen_server</strong>) implemented using
this module has a standard set of interface functions and
includes functionality for tracing and error reporting. It also
fits into an OTP supervision tree. For more information, see section
<a href="./gen_server_concepts"> gen_server Behaviour</a> in OTP Design Principles.A <strong>gen_server</strong> process assumes all specific parts to be located in
a callback module exporting a predefined set of functions.
The relationship between the behavior functions and the callback
functions is as follows:<pre>
gen_server module            Callback module
-----------------            ---------------
gen_server:start
gen_server:start_link -----&gt; Module:init/1

gen_server:stop       -----&gt; Module:terminate/2

gen_server:call
gen_server:multi_call -----&gt; Module:handle_call/3

gen_server:cast
gen_server:abcast     -----&gt; Module:handle_cast/2

-                     -----&gt; Module:terminate/2

-                     -----&gt; Module:code_change/3</pre>If a callback function fails or returns a bad value, the
<strong>gen_server</strong> process terminates.A <strong>gen_server</strong> process handles system messages as described in
<a href="sys">sys</a>. The <strong>sys</strong> module
can be used for debugging a <strong>gen_server</strong> process.Notice that a <strong>gen_server</strong> process does not trap exit signals
automatically, this must be explicitly initiated in the callback
module.Unless otherwise stated, all functions in this module fail if
the specified <strong>gen_server</strong> process does not exist or if bad
arguments are specified.The <strong>gen_server</strong> process can go into hibernation
(see <a href="../erts/erlang#hibernate/3">erts/erlang#hibernate/3</a>) if a callback
function specifies <strong>'hibernate'</strong> instead of a time-out value. This
can be useful if the server is expected to be idle for a long
time. However, use this feature with care, as hibernation
implies at least two garbage collections (when hibernating and
shortly after waking up) and is not something you want to do
between each call to a busy server.If the <strong>gen_server</strong> process needs to perform an action
immediately after initialization or to break the execution of a
callback into multiple steps, it can return <strong>{continue,Continue}</strong>
in place of the time-out or hibernation value, which will immediately
invoke the <strong>handle_continue/2</strong> callback.</p><h2>Functions</h2><h3>abcast(Name, Request) -&gt; abcast</h3><h3>abcast(Nodes, Name, Request) -&gt; abcast</h3><p>Send an asynchronous request to many generic servers.</p><ul><li><span class="v">Nodes = [Node]</span></li><li><span class="v">Â Node = atom()</span></li><li><span class="v">Name = atom()</span></li><li><span class="v">Request = term()</span></li></ul><p>Sends an asynchronous request to the <strong>gen_server</strong> processes

<strong>gen_statem</strong> provides a generic state machine behaviour
and replaces its predecessor
<a href="gen_fsm">gen_fsm</a>
since Erlang/OTP 20.0.

This reference manual describes types generated from the types
in the <strong>gen_statem</strong> source code, so they are correct.
However, the generated descriptions also reflect the type hiearchy,
which makes them kind of hard to read.

To get an overview of the concepts and operation of <strong>gen_statem</strong>,
do read the
<a href="./statem"> Â Behaviour </a>
in
<a href="./users_guide"> OTP Design Principles </a>
which frequently links back to this reference manual to avoid
containing detailed facts that may rot by age.

<strong>gen_statem</strong> has got the same features that
<a href="gen_fsm">gen_fsm</a>
had and adds some really useful:
<ul><li>Co-located state code</li><li>Arbitrary term state</li><li>Event postponing</li><li>Self-generated events</li><li>State time-out</li><li>Multiple generic named time-outs</li><li>Absolute time-out time</li><li>Automatic state enter calls</li><li> Reply from other state than the request, <strong>sys</strong> traceable </li><li>Multiple <strong>sys</strong> traceable replies</li></ul>
Two
<a href="#type-callback_mode">type-callback_mode</a>
are supported:
<ul><li> <p>One for finite-state machines
(<a href="gen_fsm">gen_fsm</a> like),
which requires the state to be an atom and uses that state as
the name of the current callback function
</p> </li><li> <p>One without restriction on the state data type
that uses one callback function for all states
</p> </li></ul>
The callback model(s) for <strong>gen_statem</strong> differs from
the one for <a href="gen_fsm">gen_fsm</a>,
but it is still fairly easy to
<a href="./gen_fsm#Migration to gen_statem"> rewrite from </a> <strong>gen_fsm</strong> to <strong>gen_statem</strong>.

A generic state machine process (<strong>gen_statem</strong>) implemented
using this module has a standard set of interface functions
and includes functionality for tracing and error reporting.
It also fits into an OTP supervision tree. For more information, see
<a href="./statem">OTP Design Principles</a>.

A <strong>gen_statem</strong> assumes all specific parts to be located in a
callback module exporting a predefined set of functions.
The relationship between the behavior functions and the callback
functions is as follows:<pre>
gen_statem module            Callback module
-----------------            ---------------
gen_statem:start
gen_statem:start_link -----&gt; Module:init/1

Server start or code change
                      -----&gt; Module:callback_mode/0

gen_statem:stop       -----&gt; Module:terminate/3

gen_statem:call
gen_statem:cast
erlang:send
erlang:'!'            -----&gt; Module:StateName/3
                             Module:handle_event/4

-                     -----&gt; Module:terminate/3

-                     -----&gt; Module:code_change/4</pre>
Events are of different
<a href="#type-event_type">types</a>,
so the callback functions can know the origin of an event
and how to respond.

If a callback function fails or returns a bad value,
the <strong>gen_statem</strong> terminates, unless otherwise stated.
However, an exception of class
<a href="../erts/erlang#throw/1">erts/erlang#throw/1</a>
is not regarded as an error but as a valid return
from all callback functions.
<a name="state callback"></a>
The <em>state callback</em> for a specific
<a href="#type-state">state</a>
in a <strong>gen_statem</strong> is the callback function that is called
for all events in this state. It is selected depending on which
<a href="#type-callback_mode">type-callback_mode</a>
that the callback module defines with the callback function
<a href="#Module:callback_mode/0">Module:callback_mode/0</a>.

When the
<a href="#type-callback_mode">type-callback_mode</a>
is <strong>state_functions</strong>, the state must be an atom and
is used as the <em>state callback</em> name; see
<a href="#Module:StateName/3">Module:StateName/3</a>.
This co-locates all code for a specific state
in one function as the <strong>gen_statem</strong> engine
branches depending on state name.
Note the fact that the callback function
<a href="#Module:terminate/3">Module:terminate/3</a>
makes the state name <strong>terminate</strong> unusable in this mode.

When the
<a href="#type-callback_mode">type-callback_mode</a>
is <strong>handle_event_function</strong>, the state can be any term
and the <em>state callback</em> name is
<a href="#Module:handle_event/4">Module:handle_event/4</a>.
This makes it easy to branch depending on state or event as you desire.
Be careful about which events you handle in which
states so that you do not accidentally postpone an event
forever creating an infinite busy loop.

When <strong>gen_statem</strong> receives a process message it is
converted into an event and the
<a href="#state callback">state callback</a>
is called with the event as two arguments: type and content.
When the
<a href="#state callback">state callback</a>
has processed the event it returns to <strong>gen_statem</strong>
which does a <em>state transition</em>.
If this <em>state transition</em> is to a different state,
that is: <strong>NextState =/= State</strong>, it is a <em>state change</em>.

The
<a href="#state callback">state callback</a>
may return
<a href="#type-action">type-action</a>
for <strong>gen_statem</strong>
to execute during the <em>state transition</em>,
for example to reply to a
<a href="#call/2">call/2</a>.

One of the possible <em>transition actions</em>
is to postpone the current event.
Then it is not retried in the current state.
The <strong>gen_statem</strong> engine keeps a queue of events
divided into the postponed events
and the events still to process.
After a <em>state change</em> the queue restarts
with the postponed events.

The <strong>gen_statem</strong> event queue model is sufficient
to emulate the normal process message queue with selective receive.
Postponing an event corresponds to not matching it
in a receive statement, and changing states corresponds
to entering a new receive statement.

The
<a href="#state callback">state callback</a>
can insert events using the
<a href="#type-action">type-action</a>
<strong>next_event</strong>
and such an event is inserted in the event queue
as the next to call the
<a href="#state callback">state callback</a>
with.
That is, as if it is the oldest incoming event.
A dedicated
<a href="#type-event_type">type-event_type</a>
<strong>internal</strong> can be used for such events making them impossible
to mistake for external events.

Inserting an event replaces the trick of calling your own
state handling functions that you often would have to
resort to in, for example,
<a href="gen_fsm">gen_fsm</a>
to force processing an inserted event before others.

The <strong>gen_statem</strong> engine can automatically
make a specialized call to the
<a href="#state callback">state callback</a>
whenever a new state is entered; see 
<a href="#type-state_enter">type-state_enter</a>.
This is for writing code common to all state entries.
Another way to do it is to explicitly insert an event
at the <em>state transition</em>,
and/or to use a dedicated <em>state transition</em> function,
but that is something you will have to remember
at every <em>state transition</em> to the state(s) that need it.

For the details of a <em>state transition</em>, see type
<a href="#type-transition_option">type-transition_option</a>.

A <strong>gen_statem</strong> handles system messages as described in
<a href="sys">sys</a>.
The <strong>sys</strong> module can be used for debugging a <strong>gen_statem</strong>.

Notice that a <strong>gen_statem</strong> does not trap exit signals
automatically, this must be explicitly initiated in
the callback module (by calling
<a href="../erts/erlang#process_flag/2">erts/erlang#process_flag/2</a>.

Unless otherwise stated, all functions in this module fail if
the specified <strong>gen_statem</strong> does not exist or
if bad arguments are specified.

The <strong>gen_statem</strong> process can go into hibernation; see
<a href="./proc_lib#hibernate/3">proc_lib#hibernate/3</a>.
It is done when a
<a href="#state callback">state callback</a>
or
<a href="#Module:init/1">Module:init/1</a>
specifies <strong>hibernate</strong> in the returned
<a href="#type-action">type-action</a>
list. This feature can be useful to reclaim process heap memory
while the server is expected to be idle for a long time.
However, use this feature with care,
as hibernation can be too costly
to use after every event; see
<a href="../erts/erlang#hibernate/3">erts/erlang#hibernate/3</a>.

There is also a server start option
<a href="#type-enter_loop_opt">type-enter_loop_opt</a>
for
<a href="#start/3">start/3</a>,
<a href="#start_link/3">start_link/3</a> or
<a href="#enter_loop/4">enter_loop/4</a>,
that may be used to automatically hibernate the server.

</p><span class="name">data</span><p>
A term in which the state machine implementation
is to store any server data it needs. The difference between
this and the <a href="#type-state">type-state</a>
itself is that a change in this data does not cause

in this data would change the set of events that
are handled, then that data item is to be made
a part of the state.
</p><span class="name">event_type</span><p>
There are 3 categories of events:
<a href="#type-external_event_type">external</a>,
<a href="#type-timeout_event_type">timeout</a>,

<strong>internal</strong> events can only be generated by the

Whether the state machine should use <em>state enter calls</em>
or not is selected when starting the  <strong>gen_statem</strong>
and after code change using the return value from
<a href="#Module:callback_mode/0">Module:callback_mode/0</a>.
</p><p>
If 
<a href="#Module:callback_mode/0">Module:callback_mode/0</a>
returns a list containing <strong>state_enter</strong>,
the <strong>gen_statem</strong> engine will, at every <em>state change</em>,
call the
<a href="#state callback">state callback</a>
with arguments <strong>(enter, OldState, Data)</strong>.
This may look like an event but is really a call
performed after the previous
<a href="#state callback">state callback</a>
returned and before any event is delivered to the new
<a href="#state callback">state callback</a>.
See
<a href="#Module:StateName/3">Module:StateName/3</a>
and
<a href="#Module:handle_event/4">Module:handle_event/4</a>.
Such a call can be repeated by returning a
<a href="#type-state_callback_result">type-state_callback_result</a>
or
<a href="#type-state_callback_result">type-state_callback_result</a>
tuple from the <em>state callback</em>.
</p><p>
If 
<a href="#Module:callback_mode/0">Module:callback_mode/0</a>
does not return such a list, no <em>state enter calls</em> are done.
</p><p>
If 
<a href="#Module:code_change/4">Module:code_change/4</a>
should transform the state,
it is regarded as a state rename and not a <em>state change</em>,
which will not cause a <em>state enter call</em>.
</p><p>
Note that a <em>state enter call</em> <em>will</em> be done
right before entering the initial state even though this
actually is not a <em>state change</em>.
In this case <strong>OldState =:= State</strong>,
which cannot happen for a subsequent state change,
but will happen when repeating the <em>state enter call</em>.
</p><span class="name">transition_option</span><p>
Transition options can be set by
<a href="#type-action">actions</a>
and modify the <em>state transition</em>.
The <em>state transition</em> takes place when the
<a href="#state callback">state callback</a>
has processed an event and returns.
Here are the sequence of steps for a <em>state transition</em>:
</p><ul><li> <p>
If
<a href="#type-state_enter">type-state_enter</a>
are used, and either:
the state changes, it is the initial state,
or one of the callback results
<a href="#type-state_callback_result">type-state_callback_result</a>
or
<a href="#type-state_callback_result">type-state_callback_result</a>
is used; the <strong>gen_statem</strong> calls
the new state callback with arguments
<a href="#type-state_enter">type-state_enter</a>.
</p> <p>
Any 
<a href="#type-enter_action">actions</a>
returned from this call are handled as if they were
appended to the actions
returned by the state callback that caused the state entry.
</p> <p>
Should this <em>state enter call</em> return any of
the mentioned <strong>repeat_*</strong> callback results
it is repeated again, with the updated <strong>Data</strong>.
</p> </li><li> <p>
All
<a href="#type-action">actions</a>
are processed in order of appearance.
</p> </li><li> <p>
If
<a href="#type-postpone">type-postpone</a>
is <strong>true</strong>,
the current event is postponed.
</p> </li><li> <p>
If this is a <em>state change</em>,
the queue of incoming events
is reset to start with the oldest postponed.
</p> </li><li> <p>
All events stored with
<a href="#type-action">type-action</a>
<strong>next_event</strong>
are inserted to be processed before previously queued events.
</p> </li><li> <p>
Time-out timers
<a href="#type-event_timeout">type-event_timeout</a>,
<a href="#type-generic_timeout">type-generic_timeout</a>
and 
<a href="#type-state_timeout">type-state_timeout</a>
are handled.  Time-outs with zero time are guaranteed to be
delivered to the state machine before any external
not yet received event so if there is such a time-out requested,
the corresponding time-out zero event is enqueued as
the newest received event;
that is after already queued events
such as inserted and postponed events.
</p> <p>
Any event cancels an
<a href="#type-event_timeout">type-event_timeout</a>
so a zero time event time-out is only generated
if the event queue is empty.
</p> <p>
A <em>state change</em> cancels a
<a href="#type-state_timeout">type-state_timeout</a>
and any new transition option of this type
belongs to the new state.
</p> </li><li> <p>
If there are enqueued events the
<a href="#state callback">state callback</a>
for the possibly new state
is called with the oldest enqueued event,
and we start again from the top of this list.
</p> </li><li> <p>
Otherwise the <strong>gen_statem</strong> goes into <strong>receive</strong>
or hibernation
(if
<a href="#type-hibernate">type-hibernate</a>
is <strong>true</strong>)
to wait for the next message. In hibernation the next
non-system event awakens the <strong>gen_statem</strong>, or rather
the next incoming message awakens the <strong>gen_statem</strong>,
but if it is a system event it goes right back into hibernation.
When a new message arrives the 
<a href="#state callback">state callback</a>
is called with the corresponding event,
and we start again from the top of this sequence.
</p> </li></ul><span class="name">postpone</span><p>
If <strong>true</strong>, postpones the current event and retries
it after a <em>state change</em>
(<strong>NextState =/= State</strong>).
</p><span class="name">hibernate</span><p>
If <strong>true</strong>, hibernates the <strong>gen_statem</strong>
by calling
<a href="./proc_lib#hibernate/3">proc_lib#hibernate/3</a>
before going into <strong>receive</strong>
to wait for a new external event.
</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>
If there are enqueued events to process
when hibrnation is requested,
this is optimized by not hibernating but instead calling
<a href="../erts/erlang#garbage_collect/0">erts/erlang#garbage_collect/0</a>
to simulate that the <strong>gen_statem</strong> entered hibernation
and immediately got awakened by an enqueued event.

Any event that arrives cancels this time-out.
Note that a retried or inserted event counts as arrived.
So does a state time-out zero event, if it was generated

</p><p>

</p><h2>Functions</h2><h3>call/2</h3><h3>call/3</h3><p>Make a synchronous call to a <strong>gen_statem</strong>.</p><p>
Makes a synchronous call to the <strong>gen_statem</strong>
<a href="#type-server_ref">type-server_ref</a>
by sending a request
and waiting until its reply arrives.
The <strong>gen_statem</strong> calls the
<a href="#state callback">state callback</a>
with
<a href="#type-event_type">type-event_type</a>
<strong>{call,From}</strong> and event content
<strong><span class="anno">Request</span></strong>.
</p><p>
A <strong><span class="anno">Reply</span></strong> is generated when a
<a href="#state callback">state callback</a>
returns with
<strong>{reply,From,<span class="anno">Reply</span>}</strong> as one
<a href="#type-action">type-action</a>,
and that <strong><span class="anno">Reply</span></strong> becomes the return value
of this function.
</p><p>
<strong><span class="anno">Timeout</span></strong> is an integer &gt; 0,
which specifies how many milliseconds to wait for a reply,
or the atom <strong>infinity</strong> to wait indefinitely,
which is the default. If no reply is received within
the specified time, the function call fails.
</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>
For <strong><span class="anno">Timeout</span> &lt; infinity</strong>,
to avoid getting a late reply in the caller's
inbox if the caller should catch exceptions,
this function spawns a proxy process that
does the call. A late reply gets delivered to the
dead proxy process, hence gets discarded. This is
less efficient than using
<strong><span class="anno">Timeout</span> == infinity</strong>.
</p></div><p>
<strong><span class="anno">Timeout</span></strong> can also be a tuple
<strong>{clean_timeout,<span class="anno">T</span>}</strong> or
<strong>{dirty_timeout,<span class="anno">T</span>}</strong>, where
<strong><span class="anno">T</span></strong> is the time-out time.
<strong>{clean_timeout,<span class="anno">T</span>}</strong> works like
just <strong>T</strong> described in the note above
and uses a proxy process
while <strong>{dirty_timeout,<span class="anno">T</span>}</strong>
bypasses the proxy process which is more lightweight.
</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>
If you combine catching exceptions from this function
with <strong>{dirty_timeout,<span class="anno">T</span>}</strong>
to avoid that the calling process dies when the call
times out, you will have to be prepared to handle
a late reply.  Note that there is an odd chance
to get a late reply even with
<strong>{dirty_timeout,infinity}</strong> or <strong>infinity</strong>
for example in the event of network problems.
So why not just let the calling process die
by not catching the exception?
</p></div><p>
The call can also fail, for example, if the <strong>gen_statem</strong>
dies before or during this function call.

This function is called by a <strong>gen_statem</strong>
when it needs to find out the
<a href="#type-callback_mode">type-callback_mode</a>
of the callback module.  The value is cached by <strong>gen_statem</strong>
for efficiency reasons, so this function is only called
once after server start and after code change,
but before the first
<a href="#state callback">state callback</a>
in the current code version is called.
More occasions may be added in future versions
of <strong>gen_statem</strong>.
</p><p>
Server start happens either when
<a href="#Module:init/1">Module:init/1</a>
returns or when
<a href="#enter_loop/4">enter_loop/4</a>
is called.  Code change happens when
<a href="#Module:code_change/4">Module:code_change/4</a>
returns.
</p><p>
The <strong>CallbackMode</strong> is either just
<a href="#type-callback_mode">type-callback_mode</a>
or a list containing
<a href="#type-callback_mode">type-callback_mode</a>
and possibly the atom
<a href="#type-state_enter">type-state_enter</a>.
</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>
If this function's body does not return an inline constant
value the callback module is doing something strange.

This callback is optional, so callback modules need not export it.
If a release upgrade/downgrade with
<strong>Change = {advanced,Extra}</strong>
specified in the <strong>.appup</strong> file is made
when <strong>code_change/4</strong> is not implemented
the process will crash with exit reason <strong>undef</strong>.
</p></div><p>
This function is called by a <strong>gen_statem</strong> when it is to
update its internal state during a release upgrade/downgrade,
that is, when the instruction <strong>{update,Module,Change,...}</strong>,
where <strong>Change = {advanced,Extra}</strong>, is specified in the
<a href="./appup">sasl/appup</a>
file. For more information, see
<a href="../doc/design_principles/release_handling#instr">OTP Design Principles</a>.
</p><p>
For an upgrade, <strong>OldVsn</strong> is <strong>Vsn</strong>, and
for a downgrade, <strong>OldVsn</strong> is
<strong>{down,Vsn}</strong>. <strong>Vsn</strong> is defined by the <strong>vsn</strong>
attribute(s) of the old version of the callback module
<strong>Module</strong>. If no such attribute is defined, the version
is the checksum of the Beam file.
</p><p>
<strong>OldState</strong> and <strong>OldData</strong> is the internal state
of the <strong>gen_statem</strong>.
</p><p>
<strong>Extra</strong> is passed "as is" from the <strong>{advanced,Extra}</strong>
part of the update instruction.
</p><p>
If successful, the function must return the updated
internal state in an
<strong>{ok,NewState,NewData}</strong> tuple.
</p><p>
If the function returns a failure <strong>Reason</strong>, the ongoing
upgrade fails and rolls back to the old release.
Note that <strong>Reason</strong> cannot be an <strong>{ok,_,_}</strong> tuple
since that will be regarded as a
<strong>{ok,NewState,NewData}</strong> tuple,
and that a tuple matching <strong>{ok,_}</strong>
is an also invalid failure <strong>Reason</strong>.
It is recommended to use an atom as <strong>Reason</strong> since
it will be wrapped in an <strong>{error,Reason}</strong> tuple.
</p><p>
Also note when upgrading a <strong>gen_statem</strong>,
this function and hence
the <strong>Change = {advanced,Extra}</strong> parameter in the
<a href="./appup">sasl/appup</a> file
is not only needed to update the internal state
or to act on the <strong>Extra</strong> argument.
It is also needed if an upgrade or downgrade should change 
<a href="#type-callback_mode">type-callback_mode</a>,
or else the <em>callback mode</em> after the code change
will not be honoured,
most probably causing a server crash.

Whenever a <strong>gen_statem</strong> is started using
<a href="#start_link/3">start_link/3</a>
or
<a href="#start/3">start/3</a>,
this function is called by the new process to initialize
the implementation state and server data.
</p><p>
<strong>Args</strong> is the <strong>Args</strong> argument provided to that start
function.
</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>
Note that if the <strong>gen_statem</strong> is started through
<a href="proc_lib">proc_lib</a>
and
<a href="#enter_loop/4">enter_loop/4</a>,
this callback will never be called.
Since this callback is not optional it can
in that case be implemented as:
</p><pre>
init(Args) -&gt; erlang:error(not_implemented, [Args]).</pre></div><h3>Module:format_status(Opt, [PDict,State,Data]) -&gt;

This callback is optional, so a callback module does not need
to export it. The <strong>gen_statem</strong> module provides a default
implementation of this function that returns
<strong>{State,Data}</strong>.
</p><p>
If this callback is exported but fails,
to hide possibly sensitive data,
the default function will instead return <strong>{State,Info}</strong>,
where <strong>Info</strong> says nothing but the fact that
<strong>format_status/2</strong> has crashed.
</p></div><p>This function is called by a <strong>gen_statem</strong> process when
any of the following apply:</p><ul><li> One of <a href="./sys#get_status/1">sys#get_status/1</a> is invoked to get the <strong>gen_statem</strong> status. <strong>Opt</strong> is set to the atom <strong>normal</strong> for this case. </li><li> The <strong>gen_statem</strong> terminates abnormally and logs an error. <strong>Opt</strong> is set to the atom <strong>terminate</strong> for this case. </li></ul><p>
This function is useful for changing the form and
appearance of the <strong>gen_statem</strong> status for these cases. A
callback module wishing to change the
<a href="./sys#get_status/1">sys#get_status/1</a>
return value and how
its status appears in termination error logs exports an
instance of <strong>format_status/2</strong>, which returns a term
describing the current status of the <strong>gen_statem</strong>.
</p><p>
<strong>PDict</strong> is the current value of the process dictionary
of the <strong>gen_statem</strong>.
</p><p>
<a href="#type-state">type-state</a>
is the internal state of the <strong>gen_statem</strong>.
</p><p>
<a href="#type-data">type-data</a>
is the internal server data of the <strong>gen_statem</strong>.
</p><p>
The function is to return <strong>Status</strong>, a term that
contains the appropriate details
of the current state and status of
the <strong>gen_statem</strong>. There are no restrictions on the
form <strong>Status</strong> can take, but for the
<a href="./sys#get_status/1">sys#get_status/1</a>
case (when <strong>Opt</strong>
is <strong>normal</strong>), the recommended form for
the <strong>Status</strong> value is <strong>[{data, [{"State", Term}]}]</strong>, where <strong>Term</strong> provides relevant details of
the <strong>gen_statem</strong> state. Following this recommendation is not
required, but it makes the callback module status
consistent with the rest of the
<a href="./sys#get_status/1">sys#get_status/1</a>
return value.
</p><p>
One use for this function is to return compact alternative
state representations to avoid having large state terms
printed in log files. Another use is to hide sensitive data from
being written to the error log.

Whenever a <strong>gen_statem</strong> receives an event from
<a href="#call/2">call/2</a>,
<a href="#cast/2">cast/2</a>, or
as a normal process message, one of these functions is called. If
<a href="#type-callback_mode">type-callback_mode</a>
is <strong>state_functions</strong>, <strong>Module:StateName/3</strong> is called,
and if it is <strong>handle_event_function</strong>,
<strong>Module:handle_event/4</strong> is called.
</p><p>
If <strong>EventType</strong> is
<a href="#type-event_type">type-event_type</a>,
the caller waits for a reply. The reply can be sent
from this or from any other
<a href="#state callback">state callback</a>
by returning with <strong>{reply,From,Reply}</strong> in
<a href="#type-action">type-action</a>, in
<a href="#type-reply_action">type-reply_action</a>,
or by calling
<a href="#reply/2">reply/2</a>.
</p><p>
If this function returns with a next state that
does not match equal (<strong>=/=</strong>) to the current state,
all postponed events are retried in the next state.
</p><p>
The only difference between <strong>StateFunctionResult</strong> and
<strong>HandleEventResult</strong> is that for <strong>StateFunctionResult</strong>
the next state must be an atom, but for <strong>HandleEventResult</strong>
there is no restriction on the next state.
</p><p>
For options that can be set and actions that can be done
by <strong>gen_statem</strong> after returning from this function,
see <a href="#type-action">type-action</a>.
</p><p>
When the <strong>gen_statem</strong> runs with
<a href="#type-state_enter">type-state_enter</a>,
these functions are also called with arguments
<strong>(enter, OldState, ...)</strong> during every <em>state change</em>.
In this case there are some restrictions on the
<a href="#type-enter_action">actions</a>
that may be returned:
<a href="#type-postpone">type-postpone</a>
is not allowed since a <em>state enter call</em> is not
an event so there is no event to postpone, and 
<a href="#type-action">type-action</a>
is not allowed since using <em>state enter calls</em>
should not affect how events are consumed and produced.
You may also not change states from this call.
Should you return <strong>{next_state,NextState, ...}</strong>
with <strong>NextState =/= State</strong> the <strong>gen_statem</strong> crashes.
Note that it is actually allowed to use
<strong>{repeat_state, NewData, ...}</strong> although it makes little
sense since you immediately will be called again with a new
<em>state enter call</em> making this just a weird way
of looping, and there are better ways to loop in Erlang.
If you do not update <strong>NewData</strong> and have some
loop termination condition, or if you use
<strong>{repeat_state_and_data, _}</strong> or
<strong>repeat_state_and_data</strong> you have an infinite loop!
You are advised to use <strong>{keep_state,...}</strong>,
<strong>{keep_state_and_data,_}</strong> or
<strong>keep_state_and_data</strong>
since changing states from a <em>state enter call</em>
is not possible anyway.
</p><p>
Note the fact that you can use
<a href="../erts/erlang#throw/1">erts/erlang#throw/1</a>
to return the result, which can be useful.
For example to bail out with <strong>throw(keep_state_and_data)</strong>
from deep within complex code that cannot
return <strong>{next_state,State,Data}</strong> because
<strong>State</strong> or <strong>Data</strong> is no longer in scope.

This function is called by a <strong>gen_statem</strong>
when it is about to terminate. It is to be the opposite of
<a href="#Module:init/1">Module:init/1</a>
and do any necessary cleaning up. When it returns,
the <strong>gen_statem</strong> terminates with <strong>Reason</strong>. The return
value is ignored.</p><p>
<strong>Reason</strong> is a term denoting the stop reason and
<a href="#type-state">type-state</a>
is the internal state of the <strong>gen_statem</strong>.
</p><p>
<strong>Reason</strong> depends on why the <strong>gen_statem</strong>
is terminating.
If it is because another callback function has returned, a
stop tuple <strong>{stop,Reason}</strong> in
<a href="#type-action">type-action</a>,
<strong>Reason</strong> has the value specified in that tuple.
If it is because of a failure, <strong>Reason</strong> is the error reason.
</p><p>
If the <strong>gen_statem</strong> is part of a supervision tree and is
ordered by its supervisor to terminate, this function is
called with <strong>Reason = shutdown</strong> if both the following
conditions apply:</p><ul><li> <p>
The <strong>gen_statem</strong> has been set
to trap exit signals.
</p> </li><li> <p>
The shutdown strategy as defined in the supervisor's
child specification is an integer time-out value, not
<strong>brutal_kill</strong>.
</p> </li></ul><p>
Even if the <strong>gen_statem</strong> is <em>not</em>
part of a supervision tree, this function is called
if it receives an <strong>'EXIT'</strong> message from its parent.
<strong>Reason</strong> is the same as
in the <strong>'EXIT'</strong> message.
</p><p>
Otherwise, the <strong>gen_statem</strong> is immediately terminated.
</p><p>
Notice that for any other reason than <strong>normal</strong>,
<strong>shutdown</strong>, or <strong>{shutdown,Term}</strong>,
the <strong>gen_statem</strong> is assumed to terminate because of an error
and an error report is issued using
<a href="./logger">kernel/logger</a>.

negative value means that the argument is left-justified
within the field, otherwise right-justified. If no

used. If the field width specified is too small, the
whole field is filled with <strong>*</strong> characters.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>P</strong> is the <strong>precision</strong> of the printed argument. A
default value is used if no precision is specified. The
interpretation of precision depends on the control sequences.
Unless otherwise specified, argument <strong>within</strong> is used
to determine print width.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>Pad</strong> is the padding character. This is the character
used to pad the printed representation of the argument so that
it conforms to the specified field width and precision. Only
one padding character can be specified and, whenever
applicable, it is used for both the field width and precision.
The default padding character is <strong>' '</strong> (space).</p> </li><li> <p><strong>Mod</strong> is the control sequence modifier. This is
one or more characters that change the interpretation of

translation, and <strong>l</strong>, for stopping <strong>p</strong> and <strong>P</strong>
from detecting printable characters.</p> </li></ul><p>If <strong>F</strong>, <strong>P</strong>, or <strong>Pad</strong> is a <strong>*</strong> character,
the next argument in <strong>Data</strong> is used as the value.

characters outside the Latin-1 range of codepoints, in
atoms, strings, and binaries. For example, printing an atom

encoding when
the system is started. The encoding is set with the help of the
<strong>LANG</strong> or <strong>LC_CTYPE</strong> environment variables on Unix-like
system or by other means on other systems.
So, the user can input Unicode characters and the I/O device
is in <strong>{encoding, unicode}</strong> mode if the I/O device supports
it. The mode can be changed, if the assumption of the runtime
system is wrong, by setting this option.</p> <p>The I/O device used when Erlang is started with the "-oldshell"
or "-noshell" flags is by default set to <strong>latin1</strong> encoding,
meaning that any characters &gt; codepoint 255 are escaped
and that input is expected to be plain 8-bit ISO Latin-1.
If the encoding is changed to Unicode, input and output from
the standard file descriptors are in UTF-8 (regardless of
operating system).</p> <p>Files can also be set in <strong>{encoding, unicode}</strong>, meaning

This has the effect that data is expected to be read as the

(<strong><span class="anno">IoDevice</span></strong>).</p><h3>Standard Input/Output</h3><p>All Erlang processes have a default standard I/O device. This
device is used when no <strong>IoDevice</strong> argument is specified in
the function calls in this module. However, it is sometimes desirable to
use an explicit <strong>IoDevice</strong> argument that refers to the
default I/O device. This is the case with functions that can
access either a file or the default I/O device. The atom
<strong>standard_io</strong> has this special meaning. The following example
illustrates this:</p><pre>
27&gt; <span class="input">io:read('enter&gt;').</span>
enter&gt;<span class="input">foo.</span>
{ok,foo}
28&gt; <span class="input">io:read(standard_io, 'enter&gt;').</span>
enter&gt;<span class="input">bar.</span>
{ok,bar}</pre><p>There is always a process registered under the name of
<strong>user</strong>. This can be used for sending output to the user.</p><h3>Standard Error</h3><p>In certain situations, especially when the standard output is
redirected, access to an I/O server specific for error messages can be
convenient. The I/O device <strong>standard_error</strong> can be used to direct
output to whatever the current operating system considers a suitable
I/O device for error output. Example on a Unix-like operating system:</p><pre>
$ <span class="input">erl -noshell -noinput -eval 'io:format(standard_error,"Error: ~s~n",["error 11"]),'\</span>
<span class="input">'init:stop().' &gt; /dev/null</span>
Error: error 11</pre><h3>Error Information</h3><p>The <strong>ErrorInfo</strong> mentioned in this module is the standard
<strong>ErrorInfo</strong> structure that is returned from all I/O modules.
It has the following format:</p><pre><code class="">
{ErrorLocation, Module, ErrorDescriptor}</code></pre><p>A string that describes the error is obtained with the following
call:</p><pre><code class="">
Module:format_error(ErrorDescriptor)</code></pre><h2>io_lib</h2><p>I/O library functions.</p><p>This module contains functions for converting to and from

in any <strong>gen_event</strong> process. It logs onto disk all events that are
sent to an event manager. Each event is written as a binary, which makes
the logging very fast. However, a tool such as the Report Browser
(<a href="./rb">sasl/rb</a>) must be used to read
the files. The events are written to multiple files. When all files have
been used, the first one is reused and overwritten. The directory
location, the number of files, and the size of each file are configurable.
The directory will include one file called <strong>index</strong>, and report files
<strong>1, 2, ...</strong>.</p><h2>Data Types</h2><span class="name">args</span><p>Term to be sent to <a href="./gen_event#add_handler/3">gen_event#add_handler/3</a>.</p><h2>Functions</h2><h3>init/3</h3><h3>init/4</h3><p>Initiate the event handler.</p><p>Initiates the event handler.

    specifications.</p><p><a name="top"></a>This module provides the parse transformation that makes calls to
<a href="ets">ets</a> and
<a href="../runtime_tools/dbg#fun2ms/1">runtime_tools/dbg#fun2ms/1</a>
translate into literal match specifications. It also provides the back end
for the same functions when called from the Erlang shell.The translation from funs to match specifications
is accessed through the two "pseudo functions"
<a href="./ets#fun2ms/1">ets#fun2ms/1</a> and
<a href="../runtime_tools/dbg#fun2ms/1">runtime_tools/dbg#fun2ms/1</a>.As everyone trying to use
<a href="./ets#select/1">ets#select/1</a> or
<a href="./dbg">runtime_tools/dbg</a> seems to end up
reading this manual page, this description is an introduction to the
concept of match specifications.Read the whole manual page if it is the first time you are using
the transformations.Match specifications are used more or less as filters. They resemble
usual Erlang matching in a list comprehension or in a fun used with
<a href="./lists#foldl/3">lists#foldl/3</a>, and so on.
However, the syntax of pure match specifications is awkward, as
they are made up purely by Erlang terms, and the language has no
syntax to make the match specifications more readable.As the execution and structure of the match specifications are like
that of a fun, it is more straightforward
to write it using the familiar fun syntax and to have that
translated into a match specification automatically. A real fun is
clearly more powerful than the match specifications allow, but bearing
the match specifications in mind, and what they can do, it is still
more convenient to write it all as a fun. This module contains the
code that translates the fun syntax into match specification
terms.</p><h3>Example 1</h3><p>Using <a href="./ets#select/2">ets#select/2</a>
and a match specification, one can filter out rows of
a table and construct a list of tuples containing relevant parts
of the data in these rows.
One can use <a href="./ets#foldl/3">ets#foldl/3</a>
instead, but the <strong>ets:select/2</strong> call is far more efficient.
Without the translation provided by <strong>ms_transform</strong>,
one must struggle with writing match specifications terms
to accommodate this.</p><p>Consider a simple table of employees:</p><pre><code class="">

straightforward, so the only problem is that all the data from the
table must be transferred from the table to the calling process for
filtering. That is inefficient compared to the <strong>ets:match/2</strong>
call where the filtering can be done "inside" the emulator and only
the result is transferred to the process.</p><p>Consider a "pure" <strong>ets:select/2</strong> call that does what
<strong>ets:foldr</strong> does:</p><pre><code class="">
ets:select(emp_tab, [{#emp{empno = '$1', dept = sales, _='_'},[],['$1']}]).</code></pre><p>Although the record syntax is used, it is still hard to
read and even harder to write. The first element of the tuple,
<strong>#emp{empno = '$1', dept = sales, _='_'}</strong>, tells what to
match. Elements not matching this are not returned, as in
the <strong>ets:match/2</strong> example. The second element, the empty list,
is a list of guard expressions, which we do not need. The third
element is the list of expressions constructing the return value (in
ETS this is almost always a list containing one single term).
In our case <strong>'$1'</strong> is bound to the employee number in the head
(first element of the tuple), and hence the employee number is
returned. The result is <strong>["011103","076324"]</strong>, as in
the <strong>ets:foldr/3</strong> example, but the result is retrieved much
more efficiently in terms of execution speed and
memory consumption.</p><p>Using <strong>ets:fun2ms/1</strong>, we can combine the ease of use of
the <strong>ets:foldr/3</strong> and the efficiency of the pure
<strong>ets:select/2</strong> example:</p><pre><code class="">
-include_lib("stdlib/include/ms_transform.hrl").

ets:select(emp_tab, ets:fun2ms(
                      fun(#emp{empno = E, dept = sales}) -&gt;
                              E
                      end)).</code></pre><p>This example requires no special knowledge of match
specifications to understand. The head of the fun matches what
you want to filter out and the body returns what you want
returned. As long as the fun can be kept within the limits of the
match specifications, there is no need to transfer all table data
to the process for filtering as in the <strong>ets:foldr/3</strong>
example. It is easier to read than the <strong>ets:foldr/3</strong> example,
as the select call in itself discards anything that does not
match, while the fun of the <strong>ets:foldr/3</strong> call needs to
handle both the elements matching and the ones not matching.</p><p>In the <strong>ets:fun2ms/1</strong> example above, it is needed to
include <strong>ms_transform.hrl</strong> in the source code, as this is
what triggers the parse transformation of the <strong>ets:fun2ms/1</strong>
call to a valid match specification. This also implies that the
transformation is done at compile time (except when called from
the shell) and therefore takes no resources in runtime. That is,
although you use the more intuitive fun syntax, it gets as
efficient in runtime as writing match specifications by hand.</p><h3>Example 2</h3><p>Assume that we want to get all the employee numbers of employees
hired before year 2000. Using <strong>ets:match/2</strong> is not
an alternative here, as relational operators cannot be
expressed there.
Once again, <strong>ets:foldr/3</strong> can do it (slowly, but correct):</p><pre><code class="">
ets:foldr(fun(#emp{empno = E, empyear = Y},Acc) when Y &lt; 2000 -&gt; [E | Acc];
                  (_,Acc) -&gt; Acc
          end,
          [],
          emp_tab).    </code></pre><p>The result is <strong>["052341","076324","535216","789789","989891"]</strong>,
as expected. The equivalent expression using a handwritten match
specification would look like this:</p><pre><code class="">
ets:select(emp_tab, [{#emp{empno = '$1', empyear = '$2', _='_'},
                     [{'&lt;', '$2', 2000}],
                     ['$1']}]).    </code></pre><p>This gives the same result. <strong>[{'&lt;', '$2', 2000}]</strong> is in
the guard part and therefore discards anything that does not have an
<strong>empyear</strong> (bound to <strong>'$2'</strong> in the head) less than 2000, as
the guard in the <strong>foldr/3</strong> example.</p><p>We write it using <strong>ets:fun2ms/1</strong>:</p><pre><code class="">
-include_lib("stdlib/include/ms_transform.hrl").

ets:select(emp_tab, ets:fun2ms(
                      fun(#emp{empno = E, empyear = Y}) when Y &lt; 2000 -&gt;
                           E
                      end)).    </code></pre><h3>Example 3</h3><p>Assume that we want the whole object matching instead of only one
element. One alternative is to assign a variable to every part
of the record and build it up once again in the body of the fun, but
the following is easier:</p><pre><code class="">
ets:select(emp_tab, ets:fun2ms(
                      fun(Obj = #emp{empno = E, empyear = Y}) 
                         when Y &lt; 2000 -&gt;
                              Obj
                      end)).</code></pre><p>As in ordinary Erlang matching, you can bind a variable to the
whole matched object using a "match inside the match", that is, a
<strong>=</strong>. Unfortunately in funs translated to match specifications,
it is allowed only at the "top-level", that is,
matching the <em>whole</em> object arriving to be matched
into a separate variable.
If you are used to writing match specifications by hand, we
mention that variable A is simply translated into '$_'.
Alternatively, pseudo function <strong>object/0</strong>
also returns the whole matched object, see section
<a href="#warnings_and_restrictions"> Warnings and Restrictions</a>.</p><h3>Example 4</h3><p>This example concerns the body of the fun. Assume that all employee
numbers beginning with zero (<strong>0</strong>) must be changed to begin with
one (<strong>1</strong>) instead, and that we want to create the list
<strong>[{&lt;Old empno&gt;,&lt;New empno&gt;}]</strong>:</p><pre><code class="">
ets:select(emp_tab, ets:fun2ms(
                      fun(#emp{empno = [$0 | Rest] }) -&gt;
                              {[$0|Rest],[$1|Rest]}
                      end)).</code></pre><p>This query hits the feature of partially bound
keys in table type <strong>ordered_set</strong>, so that not the whole
table needs to be searched, only the part containing keys
beginning with <strong>0</strong> is looked into.</p><h3>Example 5</h3><p>The fun can have many clauses. Assume that we want to do
the following:</p><ul><li> <p>If an employee started before 1997, return the tuple
<strong>{inventory, &lt;employee number&gt;}</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p>If an employee started 1997 or later, but before 2001, return
<strong>{rookie, &lt;employee number&gt;}</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p>For all other employees, return
<strong>{newbie, &lt;employee number&gt;}</strong>, except for those
named <strong>Smith</strong> as they would be affronted by anything other
than the tag <strong>guru</strong> and that is also what is returned for their
numbers: <strong>{guru, &lt;employee number&gt;}</strong>.</p> </li></ul><p>This is accomplished as follows:</p><pre><code class="">
ets:select(emp_tab, ets:fun2ms(
                      fun(#emp{empno = E, surname = "Smith" }) -&gt;
                              {guru,E};
                         (#emp{empno = E, empyear = Y}) when Y &lt; 1997  -&gt;
                              {inventory, E};
                         (#emp{empno = E, empyear = Y}) when Y &gt; 2001  -&gt;
                              {newbie, E};
                         (#emp{empno = E, empyear = Y}) -&gt; % 1997 -- 2001
                              {rookie, E}
                      end)).    </code></pre><p>The result is as follows:</p><pre><code class="">
[{rookie,"011103"},
 {rookie,"041231"},
 {guru,"052341"},
 {guru,"076324"},
 {newbie,"122334"},
 {rookie,"535216"},
 {inventory,"789789"},
 {newbie,"963721"},
 {rookie,"989891"}]</code></pre><h3>Useful BIFs</h3><p>What more can you do? A simple answer is: see the documentation of
<a href="./match_spec">match specifications</a>
in ERTS User's Guide.
However, the following is a brief overview of the most useful "built-in
functions" that you can use when the fun is to be translated into a match
specification by
<a href="./ets#fun2ms/1">ets#fun2ms/1</a>. It is not
possible to call other functions than those allowed in match
specifications. No "usual" Erlang code can be executed by the fun that
is translated by <strong>ets:fun2ms/1</strong>. The fun is limited
exactly to the power of the match specifications, which is
unfortunate, but the price one must pay for the execution speed of
<strong>ets:select/2</strong> compared to <strong>ets:foldl/foldr</strong>.</p><p>The head of the fun is a head matching (or mismatching)
<em>one</em> parameter, one object of the table we select
from. The object is always a single variable (can be <strong>_</strong>) or
a tuple, as ETS, Dets, and Mnesia tables include
that. The match specification returned by <strong>ets:fun2ms/1</strong> can
be used with <strong>dets:select/2</strong> and <strong>mnesia:select/2</strong>, and
with <strong>ets:select/2</strong>. The use of <strong>=</strong> in the head
is allowed (and encouraged) at the top-level.</p><p>The guard section can contain any guard expression of Erlang.
The following is a list of BIFs and expressions:</p><ul><li> <p>Type tests: <strong>is_atom</strong>, <strong>is_float</strong>, <strong>is_integer</strong>,
<strong>is_list</strong>, <strong>is_number</strong>, <strong>is_pid</strong>, <strong>is_port</strong>,
<strong>is_reference</strong>, <strong>is_tuple</strong>, <strong>is_binary</strong>,
<strong>is_function</strong>, <strong>is_record</strong></p> </li><li> <p>Boolean operators: <strong>not</strong>, <strong>and</strong>, <strong>or</strong>,
<strong>andalso</strong>, <strong>orelse</strong></p> </li><li> <p>Relational operators: &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;, =&lt;, =:=, ==, =/=, /=</p> </li><li> <p>Arithmetics: <strong>+</strong>, <strong>-</strong>, <strong>*</strong>,
<strong>div</strong>, <strong>rem</strong></p> </li><li> <p>Bitwise operators: <strong>band</strong>, <strong>bor</strong>, <strong>bxor</strong>, <strong>bnot</strong>,
<strong>bsl</strong>, <strong>bsr</strong></p> </li><li> <p>The guard BIFs: <strong>abs</strong>, <strong>element</strong>,
<strong>hd</strong>, <strong>length</strong>,
<strong>node</strong>, <strong>round</strong>, <strong>size</strong>, <strong>tl</strong>, <strong>trunc</strong>,
<strong>self</strong></p> </li></ul><p>Contrary to the fact with "handwritten" match specifications, the
<strong>is_record</strong> guard works as in ordinary Erlang code.</p><p>Semicolons (<strong>;</strong>) in guards are allowed, the result is (as
expected) one "match specification clause" for each semicolon-separated
part of the guard. The semantics is identical to the Erlang
semantics.</p><p>The body of the fun is used to construct the
resulting value. When selecting from tables, one usually construct
a suiting term here, using ordinary Erlang term construction, like
tuple parentheses, list brackets, and variables matched out in the
head, possibly with the occasional constant. Whatever
expressions are allowed in guards are also allowed here, but no special
functions exist except <strong>object</strong> and
<strong>bindings</strong> (see further down), which returns the whole
matched object and all known variable bindings, respectively.</p><p>The <strong>dbg</strong> variants of match specifications have an
imperative approach to the match specification body, the ETS
dialect has not. The fun body for <strong>ets:fun2ms/1</strong> returns the result
without side effects. As matching (<strong>=</strong>) in the body of
the match specifications is not allowed (for performance reasons) the
only thing left, more or less, is term construction.</p><h3>Example with dbg</h3><p>This section describes the slightly different match specifications
translated by <a href="../runtime_tools/dbg#fun2ms/1">runtime_tools/dbg#fun2ms/1</a>.</p><p>The same reasons for using the parse transformation apply to
<strong>dbg</strong>, maybe even more, as filtering using Erlang code is
not a good idea when tracing (except afterwards, if you trace
to file). The concept is similar to that of <strong>ets:fun2ms/1</strong>
except that you usually use it directly from the shell
(which can also be done with <strong>ets:fun2ms/1</strong>).</p><p>The following is an example module to trace on:</p><pre><code class="">
-module(toy).

-export([start/1, store/2, retrieve/1]).

start(Args) -&gt;
    toy_table = ets:new(toy_table, Args).

store(Key, Value) -&gt;
    ets:insert(toy_table, {Key,Value}).

retrieve(Key) -&gt;
    [{Key, Value}] = ets:lookup(toy_table, Key),
    Value.</code></pre><p>During model testing, the first test results in
<strong>{badmatch,16}</strong> in <strong>{toy,start,1}</strong>, why?</p><p>We suspect the <strong>ets:new/2</strong> call, as we match hard on the
return value, but want only the particular <strong>new/2</strong> call with
<strong>toy_table</strong> as first parameter. So we start a default tracer
on the node:</p><pre>
1&gt; <span class="input">dbg:tracer().</span>
{ok,&lt;0.88.0&gt;}</pre><p>We turn on call tracing for all processes, we want to
make a pretty restrictive trace pattern, so there is no need to call
trace only a few processes (usually it is not):</p><pre>
2&gt; <span class="input">dbg:p(all,call).</span>
{ok,[{matched,nonode@nohost,25}]}</pre><p>We specify the filter, we want to view calls that resemble
<strong>ets:new(toy_table, &lt;something&gt;)</strong>:</p><pre>
3&gt; <span class="input">dbg:tp(ets,new,dbg:fun2ms(fun([toy_table,_]) -&gt; true end)).</span>
{ok,[{matched,nonode@nohost,1},{saved,1}]}</pre><p>As can be seen, the fun used with
<strong>dbg:fun2ms/1</strong> takes a single list as parameter instead of a
single tuple. The list matches a list of the parameters to the traced
function. A single variable can also be used. The body
of the fun expresses, in a more imperative way, actions to be taken if
the fun head (and the guards) matches. <strong>true</strong> is returned here,
only because the body of a fun cannot be empty. The return value
is discarded.</p><p>The following trace output is received during test:</p><pre><code class="">
(&lt;0.86.0&gt;) call ets:new(toy_table, [ordered_set])    </code></pre><p>Assume that we have not found the problem yet, and want to see what
<strong>ets:new/2</strong> returns. We use a slightly different trace pattern:</p><pre>
4&gt; <span class="input">dbg:tp(ets,new,dbg:fun2ms(fun([toy_table,_]) -&gt; return_trace() end)).</span></pre><p>The following trace output is received during test:</p><pre><code class="">
(&lt;0.86.0&gt;) call ets:new(toy_table,[ordered_set])
(&lt;0.86.0&gt;) returned from ets:new/2 -&gt; 24    </code></pre><p>The call to <strong>return_trace</strong> results in a trace message
when the function returns. It applies only to the specific function call
triggering the match specification (and matching the head/guards of
the match specification). This is by far the most common call in the
body of a <strong>dbg</strong> match specification.</p><p>The test now fails with <strong>{badmatch,24}</strong> because the atom
<strong>toy_table</strong> does not match the number returned for an unnamed table.
So, the problem is found, the table is to be named, and the arguments
supplied by the test program do not include <strong>named_table</strong>. We
rewrite the start function:</p><pre><code class="">
start(Args) -&gt;
    toy_table = ets:new(toy_table, [named_table|Args]).</code></pre><p>With the same tracing turned on, the following trace output is
received:</p><pre><code class="">
(&lt;0.86.0&gt;) call ets:new(toy_table,[named_table,ordered_set])
(&lt;0.86.0&gt;) returned from ets:new/2 -&gt; toy_table    </code></pre><p>Assume that the module now passes all testing and goes into
the system. After a while, it is found that table
<strong>toy_table</strong> grows while the system is running and that
there are many elements with atoms as keys. We expected
only integer keys and so does the rest of the system, but
clearly not the entire system. We turn on call tracing and try to
see calls to the module with an atom as the key:</p><pre>
1&gt; <span class="input">dbg:tracer().</span>
{ok,&lt;0.88.0&gt;}
2&gt; <span class="input">dbg:p(all,call).</span>
{ok,[{matched,nonode@nohost,25}]}
3&gt; <span class="input">dbg:tpl(toy,store,dbg:fun2ms(fun([A,_]) when is_atom(A) -&gt; true end)).</span>
{ok,[{matched,nonode@nohost,1},{saved,1}]}</pre><p>We use <strong>dbg:tpl/3</strong> to ensure to catch local calls
(assume that the module has grown since the smaller version and we are
unsure if this inserting of atoms is not done locally). When in
doubt, always use local call tracing.</p><p>Assume that nothing happens when tracing in this way. The function
is never called with these parameters. We conclude that
someone else (some other module) is doing it and realize that we
must trace on <strong>ets:insert/2</strong> and want to see the calling function.
The calling function can be retrieved using the match specification
function <strong>caller</strong>. To get it into the trace message, the match
specification function <strong>message</strong> must be used. The filter
call looks like this (looking for calls to <strong>ets:insert/2</strong>):</p><pre>
4&gt; <span class="input">dbg:tpl(ets,insert,dbg:fun2ms(fun([toy_table,{A,_}]) when is_atom(A) -&gt; </span>
<span class="input">                                    message(caller()) </span>
<span class="input">                                  end)). </span>
{ok,[{matched,nonode@nohost,1},{saved,2}]}</pre><p>The caller is now displayed in the "additional message" part of the
trace output, and the following is displayed after a while:</p><pre><code class="">
(&lt;0.86.0&gt;) call ets:insert(toy_table,{garbage,can}) ({evil_mod,evil_fun,2})    </code></pre><p>You have realized that function <strong>evil_fun</strong> of the
<strong>evil_mod</strong> module, with arity <strong>2</strong>, is causing all this trouble.
</p><p>This example illustrates the most used calls in match specifications for
<strong>dbg</strong>. The other, more esoteric, calls are listed and explained in
<a href="./match_spec">Match specifications in Erlang</a>
in ERTS User's Guide, as they are beyond
the scope of this description.</p><h3>Warnings and Restrictions</h3><a name="warnings_and_restrictions"></a><p>The following warnings and restrictions apply to the funs used in
with <strong>ets:fun2ms/1</strong> and <strong>dbg:fun2ms/1</strong>.</p><div class="alert alert-warning"><h4 class="alert-heading">Warning</h4><p>To use the pseudo functions triggering the translation,
ensure to include the header file <strong>ms_transform.hrl</strong>
in the source code. Failure to do so possibly results in
runtime errors rather than compile time, as the expression can
be valid as a plain Erlang program without translation.</p></div><div class="alert alert-warning"><h4 class="alert-heading">Warning</h4><p>The fun must be literally constructed inside the
parameter list to the pseudo functions. The fun cannot
be bound to a variable first and then passed to
<strong>ets:fun2ms/1</strong> or <strong>dbg:fun2ms/1</strong>. For example,
<strong>ets:fun2ms(fun(A) -&gt; A end)</strong> works, but not
<strong>F = fun(A) -&gt; A end, ets:fun2ms(F)</strong>. The latter results
in a compile-time error if the header is included, otherwise a
runtime error.</p></div><p>Many restrictions apply to the fun that is translated into a match
specification. To put it simple: you cannot use anything in the fun
that you cannot use in a match specification. This means that,
among others, the following restrictions apply to the fun itself:</p><ul><li> <p>Functions written in Erlang cannot be called, neither can
local functions, global functions, or real funs.</p> </li><li> <p>Everything that is written as a function call is translated
into a match specification call to a built-in function, so that
the call <strong>is_list(X)</strong> is translated to <strong>{'is_list', '$1'}</strong>
(<strong>'$1'</strong> is only an example, the numbering can vary).
If one tries to call a function that is not a match specification
built-in, it causes an error.</p> </li><li> <p>Variables occurring in the head of the fun are replaced by
match specification variables in the order of occurrence, so
that fragment <strong>fun({A,B,C})</strong> is replaced by
<strong>{'$1', '$2', '$3'}</strong>, and so on. Every occurrence of such a
variable in the match specification is replaced by a match
specification variable in the same way, so that the fun
<strong>fun({A,B}) when is_atom(A) -&gt; B end</strong> is translated into
<strong>[{{'$1','$2'},[{is_atom,'$1'}],['$2']}]</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p>Variables that are not included in the head are imported
from the environment and made into match specification
<strong>const</strong> expressions. Example from the shell:</p> <pre>
1&gt; <span class="input">X = 25.</span>
25
2&gt; <span class="input">ets:fun2ms(fun({A,B}) when A &gt; X -&gt; B end).</span>
[{{'$1','$2'},[{'&gt;','$1',{const,25}}],['$2']}]</pre> </li><li> <p>Matching with <strong>=</strong> cannot be used in the body. It can only
be used on the top-level in the head of the fun.
Example from the shell again:</p> <pre>
1&gt; <span class="input">ets:fun2ms(fun({A,[B|C]} = D) when A &gt; B -&gt; D end).</span>
[{{'$1',['$2'|'$3']},[{'&gt;','$1','$2'}],['$_']}]

Error: fun with body matching ('=' in body) is illegal as match_spec
{error,transform_error}</pre> <p>All variables are bound in the head of a match specification, so
the translator cannot allow multiple bindings. The special case
when matching is done on the top-level makes the variable bind
to <strong>'$_'</strong> in the resulting match specification. It is to allow
a more natural access to the whole matched object. Pseudo
function <strong>object()</strong> can be used instead, see below.</p> <p>The following expressions are translated equally:</p> <pre><code class="">
ets:fun2ms(fun({a,_} = A) -&gt; A end).
ets:fun2ms(fun({a,_}) -&gt; object() end).</code></pre> </li><li> <p>The special match specification variables <strong>'$_'</strong> and <strong>'$*'</strong>
can be accessed through the pseudo functions <strong>object()</strong>
(for <strong>'$_'</strong>) and <strong>bindings()</strong> (for <strong>'$*'</strong>).
As an example, one can translate the following
<strong>ets:match_object/2</strong> call to a <strong>ets:select/2</strong> call:</p> <pre><code class="">
ets:match_object(Table, {'$1',test,'$2'}). </code></pre> <p>This is the same as:</p> <pre><code class="">
ets:select(Table, ets:fun2ms(fun({A,test,B}) -&gt; object() end)).</code></pre> <p>In this simple case, the former
expression is probably preferable in terms of readability.</p> <p>The <strong>ets:select/2</strong> call conceptually looks like this
in the resulting code:</p> <pre><code class="">
ets:select(Table, [{{'$1',test,'$2'},[],['$_']}]).</code></pre> <p>Matching on the top-level of the fun head can be a
more natural way to access <strong>'$_'</strong>, see above.</p> </li><li> <p>Term constructions/literals are translated as much as is needed to
get them into valid match specification. This way tuples are made
into match specification tuple constructions (a one element tuple
containing the tuple) and constant expressions are used when
importing variables from the environment. Records are also
translated into plain tuple constructions, calls to element,
and so on. The guard test <strong>is_record/2</strong> is translated into
match specification code using the three parameter version that is
built into match specification, so that <strong>is_record(A,t)</strong> is
translated into <strong>{is_record,'$1',t,5}</strong> if the record
size of record type <strong>t</strong> is 5.</p> </li><li> <p>Language constructions such as <strong>case</strong>, <strong>if</strong>, and
<strong>catch</strong> that are not present in match specifications are not
allowed.</p> </li><li> <p>If header file <strong>ms_transform.hrl</strong> is not included,
the fun is not translated, which can result in a
<em>runtime error</em> (depending on whether the fun is
valid in a pure Erlang context).</p> <p>Ensure that the header is included when using <strong>ets</strong> and
<strong>dbg:fun2ms/1</strong> in compiled code.</p> </li><li> <p>If pseudo function triggering the translation is
<strong>ets:fun2ms/1</strong>, the head of the fun must contain a single
variable or a single tuple. If the pseudo function is
<strong>dbg:fun2ms/1</strong>, the head of the fun must contain a single
variable or a single list.</p> </li></ul><p>The translation from funs to match specifications is done at compile
time, so runtime performance is not affected by using these pseudo

future loads. It returns the length of the queue of ready to run
processes in the Erlang runtime system.The slave nodes are started with the

    adhering to the OTP design principles.</p><p>This module is used to start processes adhering to
the <a href="./des_princ"> OTP Design Principles</a>. Specifically, the functions in this
module are used by the OTP standard behaviors (for example,
<strong>gen_server</strong> and <strong>gen_statem</strong>)
when starting new processes. The functions
can also be used to start <em>special processes</em>, user-defined
processes that comply to the OTP design principles. For an example,
see section <a href="./spec_proc"> sys and proc_lib</a> in OTP Design Principles.Some useful information is initialized when a process starts.
The registered names, or the process identifiers, of the parent
process, and the parent ancestors, are stored together with
information about the function initially called in the process.While in "plain Erlang", a process is said to terminate normally
only for exit reason <strong>normal</strong>, a process started
using <strong>proc_lib</strong> is also said to terminate normally if it
exits with reason <strong>shutdown</strong> or <strong>{shutdown,Term}</strong>.
<strong>shutdown</strong> is the reason used when
an application (supervision tree) is stopped.When a process that is started using <strong>proc_lib</strong> terminates
abnormally (that is, with another exit reason than <strong>normal</strong>,
<strong>shutdown</strong>, or <strong>{shutdown,Term}</strong>), a <em>crash report</em>
is generated, which is written to terminal by the default logger
handler setup by Kernel. For more information about how crash reports
were logged prior to Erlang/OTP 21.0, see
<a href="./error_logging">SASL Error Logging</a>
in the SASL User's Guide.Unlike in "plain Erlang", <strong>proc_lib</strong> processes will not generate
<em>error reports</em>, which are written to the terminal by the
emulator. All exceptions are
converted to <em>exits</em> which are ignored by the default
<strong>logger</strong> handler.The crash report contains the previously stored information, such
as ancestors and initial function, the termination reason, and
information about other processes that terminate as a result
of this process terminating.</p><h2>Data Types</h2><span class="name">spawn_option</span><p>See <a href="../erts/erlang#spawn_opt/4">erts/erlang#spawn_opt/4</a>.</p><span class="name">priority_level</span><span class="name">max_heap_size</span><p>See <a href="../erts/erlang#process_flag_max_heap_size"> erlang:process_flag(max_heap_size, MaxHeapSize)</a>.</p><span class="name">dict_or_pid</span><h2>Functions</h2><h3>format/1</h3><p>Format a crash report.</p><p>Equivalent to <a href="#format/2">format/2</a>.</p><h3>format/2</h3><p>Format a crash report.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>This function is deprecated in the sense that

of either tuples, whose first elements are keys used for lookup and
insertion, or atoms, which work as shorthand for tuples
<strong>{Atom, true}</strong>. (Other terms are allowed in the lists, but are
ignored by this module.) If there is more than one entry in a list for a
certain key, the first occurrence normally overrides any later
(irrespective of the arity of the tuples).Property lists are useful for representing inherited properties,
such as options passed to a function where a user can specify options
overriding the default settings, object properties, annotations,
and so on.Two keys are considered equal if they match (<strong>=:=</strong>). That is,
numbers are compared literally rather than by value, so that,
for example, <strong>1</strong> and <strong>1.0</strong> are different keys.</p><h2>Data Types</h2><span class="name">property</span><span class="name">proplist</span><h2>Functions</h2><h3>append_values/2</h3><p>Similar to

</p><p>This module provides a query interface to
<a href="./mnesia">Mnesia</a>,
<a href="ets">ETS</a>,
<a href="dets">Dets</a>,
and other data structures that provide an iterator style
traversal of objects.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>This module provides a query interface to <em>QLC tables</em>. Typical QLC tables are Mnesia, ETS, and
Dets tables. Support is also provided for user-defined tables, see section
<a href="#implementing_a_qlc_table"> Implementing a QLC Table</a>.
<a name="query_list_comprehension"></a>
A <em>query</em> is expressed using
<em>Query List Comprehensions</em> (QLCs). The answers to a
query are determined by data in QLC tables that fulfill the
constraints expressed by the QLCs of the query. QLCs are similar
to ordinary list comprehensions as described in
<a href="../doc/reference_manual/expressions#lcs"> Erlang Reference Manual</a> and
<a href="./list_comprehensions"> Programming Examples</a>, except that variables
introduced in patterns cannot be used in list expressions.
In the absence of optimizations and options such as
<strong>cache</strong> and <strong>unique</strong> (see section
<a href="#common_options">Common Options</a>, every
QLC free of QLC tables evaluates to the same list of answers as the
identical ordinary list comprehension.</p><p>While ordinary list comprehensions evaluate to lists, calling
<a href="#q/1">q/1</a> returns a
<a name="query_handle"></a><em>query handle</em>.
To obtain all the answers to a query, <a href="#eval/1">eval/1</a> is to be called with the
query handle as first argument. Query handles are essentially
functional objects (funs) created in the module calling <strong>q/1,2</strong>.
As the funs refer to the module code, be careful not to keep query
handles too long if the module code is to be replaced.
Code replacement is described in section
<a href="./code_loading"> Compilation and Code Loading</a> in the Erlang Reference Manual.
The list of answers can also be traversed in chunks by use of a
<a name="query_cursor"></a><em>query cursor</em>.
Query cursors are created by calling
<a href="#cursor/1">cursor/1</a> with a query
handle as first argument. Query cursors are essentially Erlang processes.
One answer at a time is sent from the query cursor process to
the process that created the cursor.</p><h3>Syntax</h3><p>Syntactically QLCs have the same parts as ordinary list
comprehensions:</p><pre><code class="">
[Expression || Qualifier1, Qualifier2, ...]</code></pre><p><strong>Expression</strong> (the <em>template</em>) is any
Erlang expression. Qualifiers are either <em>filters</em> or
<em>generators</em>. Filters are Erlang expressions returning
<strong>boolean()</strong>. Generators have the form
<strong>Pattern &lt;- ListExpression</strong>, where
<strong>ListExpression</strong> is an expression evaluating to a query
handle or a list. Query handles are returned from
<a href="#append/1">append/1</a>,
<a href="#keysort/2">keysort/2</a>,
<a href="#q/1">q/1</a>,
<a href="#sort/1">sort/1</a>,
<a href="#string_to_handle/1">string_to_handle/1</a>, and
<a href="#table/2">table/2</a>.</p><h3>Evaluation</h3><p>A query handle is evaluated in the following order:</p><ul><li> <p>Inspection of options and the collection of information about
tables. As a result, qualifiers are modified during the optimization
phase.</p> </li><li> <p>All list expressions are evaluated. If a cursor has been created,
evaluation takes place in the cursor process. For list expressions
that are QLCs, the list expressions of the generators of the QLCs
are evaluated as well. Be careful if list expressions have side
effects, as list expressions are evaluated in unspecified order.</p> </li><li> <p>The answers are found by evaluating the qualifiers from left to
right, backtracking when some filter returns <strong>false</strong>, or
collecting the template when all filters return <strong>true</strong>.</p> </li></ul><p>Filters that do not return <strong>boolean()</strong> but fail are handled
differently depending on their syntax: if the filter is a guard,
it returns <strong>false</strong>, otherwise the query evaluation fails.
This behavior makes it possible for the <strong>qlc</strong> module to do
some optimizations without affecting the meaning of a query. For
example, when testing some position of a table and one or more
constants for equality, only
the objects with equal values are candidates for further
evaluation. The other objects are guaranteed to make the filter
return <strong>false</strong>, but never fail. The (small) set of
candidate objects can often be found by looking up some key
values of the table or by traversing the table using a match
specification. It is necessary to place the guard filters
immediately after the table generator, otherwise the candidate
objects are not restricted to a small set. The reason is
that objects that could make the query evaluation fail must not
be excluded by looking up a key or running a match specification.</p><h3>Join</h3><p>The <strong>qlc</strong> module supports fast join of two query handles.
Fast join is possible if some position <strong>P1</strong> of one query
handler and some position <strong>P2</strong> of another query handler are
tested for equality. Two fast join methods are provided:</p><ul><li><p><em>Lookup join</em> traverses all objects of one query handle
and finds objects of the other handle (a QLC table) such that the
values at <strong>P1</strong> and <strong>P2</strong> match or compare equal.
The <strong>qlc</strong> module does not create
any indexes but looks up values using the key position and
the indexed positions of the QLC table.</p> </li><li><p><em>Merge join</em> sorts the objects of each query handle if
necessary and filters out objects where the values at
<strong>P1</strong> and <strong>P2</strong> do not compare equal. If
many objects with the same value of <strong>P2</strong> exist, a temporary
file is used for the equivalence classes.</p> </li></ul><p>The <strong>qlc</strong> module warns at compile time if a QLC
combines query handles in such a way that more than one join is
possible. That is, no query planner is provided that can
select a good order between possible join operations. It is up
to the user to order the joins by introducing query handles.</p><p>The join is to be expressed as a guard filter. The filter must
be placed immediately after the two joined generators, possibly
after guard filters that use variables from no other generators
but the two joined generators. The <strong>qlc</strong> module inspects
the operands of
<strong>=:=/2</strong>, <strong>==/2</strong>, <strong>is_record/2</strong>, <strong>element/2</strong>,
and logical operators (<strong>and/2</strong>, <strong>or/2</strong>,
<strong>andalso/2</strong>, <strong>orelse/2</strong>, <strong>xor/2</strong>) when
determining which joins to consider.</p><a name="common_options"></a><h3>Common Options</h3><p>The following options are accepted by
<a href="#cursor/2">cursor/2</a>,
<a href="#eval/2">eval/2</a>,
<a href="#fold/4">fold/4</a>, and
<a href="#info/2">info/2</a>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>{cache_all, Cache}</strong>, where <strong>Cache</strong> is
equal to <strong>ets</strong> or <strong>list</strong> adds a
<strong>{cache,Â Cache}</strong> option to every list expression
of the query except tables and lists. Defaults to
<strong>{cache_all,Â no}</strong>. Option <strong>cache_all</strong> is
equivalent to <strong>{cache_all,Â ets}</strong>.</p> </li><li><p><a name="max_list_size"></a><strong>{max_list_size, MaxListSize}</strong>, where <strong>MaxListSize</strong> is the
size in bytes of terms on the external format. If the
accumulated size of collected objects exceeds
<strong>MaxListSize</strong>, the objects are written onto a temporary
file. This option is used by option <strong>{cache,Â list}</strong>
and by the merge join method. Defaults to 512*1024 bytes.</p> </li><li><p><strong>{tmpdir_usage, TmpFileUsage}</strong> determines the
action taken when <strong>qlc</strong> is about to create temporary
files on the directory set by option <strong>tmpdir</strong>. If the
value is <strong>not_allowed</strong>, an error tuple is returned,
otherwise temporary files are created as needed. Default is
<strong>allowed</strong>, which means that no further action is taken.
The values <strong>info_msg</strong>, <strong>warning_msg</strong>, and
<strong>error_msg</strong> mean that the function with the corresponding
name in module
<a href="./error_logger">kernel/error_logger</a>
is called for printing some information (currently the stacktrace).</p> </li><li><p><strong>{tmpdir, TempDirectory}</strong> sets the directory used by
merge join for temporary files and by option
<strong>{cache,Â list}</strong>. The option also overrides
option <strong>tmpdir</strong> of
<a href="#keysort/3">keysort/3</a> and
<a href="#sort/2">sort/2</a>.
Defaults to <strong>""</strong>, which means that
the directory returned by <strong>file:get_cwd()</strong> is used.</p> </li><li><p><strong>{unique_all, true}</strong> adds a
<strong>{unique,Â true}</strong> option to every list expression of
the query. Defaults to <strong>{unique_all,Â false}</strong>.
Option <strong>unique_all</strong> is equivalent to
<strong>{unique_all,Â true}</strong>.</p> </li></ul><a name="getting_started"></a><h3>Getting Started</h3><p>As mentioned earlier,
queries are expressed in the list comprehension syntax as described
in section
<a href="./expressions">Expressions</a>
in Erlang Reference Manual. In the following, some familiarity
with list comprehensions is assumed. The examples in section
<a href="./list_comprehensions"> List Comprehensions</a> in Programming Examples can get you
started. Notice that list comprehensions do not add any computational
power to the language; anything that can be done with list
comprehensions can also be done without them. But they add
syntax for expressing simple search problems, which is compact
and clear once you get used to it.</p><p>Many list comprehension expressions can be evaluated by the
<strong>qlc</strong> module. Exceptions are expressions, such that
variables introduced in patterns (or filters) are used in some
generator later in the list comprehension. As an example,
consider an implementation of <strong>lists:append(L)</strong>:
<strong>[X ||Y &lt;- L, X &lt;- Y]</strong>.
<strong>Y</strong> is introduced in the first generator and used in the second.
The ordinary list comprehension is normally to be preferred when
there is a choice as to which to use. One difference is that
<a href="#eval/1">eval/1</a>
collects answers in a list that is finally
reversed, while list comprehensions collect answers on the stack
that is finally unwound.</p><p>What the <strong>qlc</strong> module primarily adds to list
comprehensions is that data can be read from QLC tables in small
chunks. A QLC table is created by calling
<a href="#table/2">table/2</a>.
Usually <strong>qlc:table/2</strong> is not called directly from the query
but through an interface function of some data structure.
Erlang/OTP includes a few examples of such functions:
<a href="../mnesia/mnesia#table/1">mnesia/mnesia#table/1</a>,
<a href="./ets#table/1">ets#table/1</a>, and
<a href="./dets#table/1">dets#table/1</a>.
For a given data structure, many functions can create QLC tables, but
common for these functions is that they return a query handle created by
<a href="#table/2">table/2</a>.
Using the QLC tables provided by Erlang/OTP is usually
probably sufficient, but for the more advanced user section
<a href="#implementing_a_qlc_table">Implementing a QLC Table</a> describes the implementation of a function
calling <strong>qlc:table/2</strong>.</p><p>Besides <strong>qlc:table/2</strong>, other functions
return query handles. They are used more seldom than tables,
but are sometimes useful.
<a href="#append/1">append/1</a> traverses
objects from many tables or lists after each other. If, for
example, you want to traverse all answers to a query <strong>QH</strong> and
then finish off by a term <strong>{finished}</strong>, you can do that by
calling <strong>qlc:append(QH, [{finished}])</strong>. <strong>append/2</strong> first
returns all objects of <strong>QH</strong>, then <strong>{finished}</strong>. If a tuple
<strong>{finished}</strong> exists among the answers to <strong>QH</strong>, it is
returned twice from <strong>append/2</strong>.</p><p>As another example, consider concatenating the answers to two
queries <strong>QH1</strong> and <strong>QH2</strong> while removing all duplicates. This is
accomplished by using option <strong>unique</strong>:</p><pre><code class="">
qlc:q([X || X &lt;- qlc:append(QH1, QH2)], {unique, true})</code></pre><p>The cost is substantial: every returned answer is stored
in an ETS table. Before returning an answer, it is looked up in
the ETS table to check if it has already been returned. Without
the <strong>unique</strong> option, all answers to <strong>QH1</strong> would be returned
followed by all answers to <strong>QH2</strong>. The <strong>unique</strong> option keeps
the order between the remaining answers.</p><p>If the order of the answers is not important, there is an
alternative to the <strong>unique</strong> option, namely to sort the
answers uniquely:</p><pre><code class="">
qlc:sort(qlc:q([X || X &lt;- qlc:append(QH1, QH2)], {unique, true})).</code></pre><p>This query also removes duplicates but the answers are
sorted. If there are many answers, temporary files are used.
Notice that to get the first unique answer, all answers
must be found and sorted. Both alternatives find duplicates by comparing
answers, that is, if <strong>A1</strong> and <strong>A2</strong> are answers found in
that order, then <strong>A2</strong> is a removed if <strong>A1 == A2</strong>.</p><p>To return only a few answers, cursors can be used. The following
code returns no more than five answers using an ETS table for
storing the unique answers:</p><pre><code class="">
C = qlc:cursor(qlc:q([X || X &lt;- qlc:append(QH1, QH2)],{unique,true})),
R = qlc:next_answers(C, 5),
ok = qlc:delete_cursor(C),
R.</code></pre><p>QLCs are convenient for stating
constraints on data from two or more tables. The following example
does a natural join on two query handles on position 2:</p><pre><code class="">
qlc:q([{X1,X2,X3,Y1} || 
          {X1,X2,X3} &lt;- QH1, 
          {Y1,Y2} &lt;- QH2, 
          X2 =:= Y2])</code></pre><p>The <strong>qlc</strong> module evaluates this differently depending on the
query handles <strong>QH1</strong> and <strong>QH2</strong>. If, for example, <strong>X2</strong> is
matched against the key of a QLC table, the lookup join method
traverses the objects of <strong>QH2</strong> while looking up key
values in the table. However, if not <strong>X2</strong> or
<strong>Y2</strong> is matched against the key or an indexed position of a
QLC table, the merge join method ensures that <strong>QH1</strong>
and <strong>QH2</strong> are both sorted on position 2 and next do the
join by traversing the objects one by one.</p><p>Option <strong>join</strong> can be used to force the <strong>qlc</strong> module to use
a certain join method. For the rest of this section it is assumed
that the excessively slow join method called "nested loop" has
been chosen:</p><pre><code class="">
qlc:q([{X1,X2,X3,Y1} || 
          {X1,X2,X3} &lt;- QH1, 
          {Y1,Y2} &lt;- QH2, 
          X2 =:= Y2],
      {join, nested_loop})</code></pre><p>In this case the filter is applied to every possible pair
of answers to <strong>QH1</strong> and <strong>QH2</strong>, one at a time.
If there are M answers to <strong>QH1</strong> and N answers to <strong>QH2</strong>,
the filter is run M*N times.</p><p>If <strong>QH2</strong> is a call to the function for
<a href="gb_trees">gb_trees</a>, as defined
in section <a href="#implementing_a_qlc_table">Implementing a QLC Table</a>, then <strong>gb_table:table/1</strong>, the
iterator for the gb-tree is initiated for each answer to
<strong>QH1</strong>. The objects of the gb-tree are then returned one
by one. This is probably the most efficient way of traversing
the table in that case, as it takes minimal computational
power to get the following object. But if <strong>QH2</strong> is not a table but
a more complicated QLC, it can be more efficient to use some RAM
memory for collecting the answers in a cache, particularly if
there are only a few answers. It must then be assumed that
evaluating <strong>QH2</strong> has no side effects so that the meaning of the
query does not change if <strong>QH2</strong> is evaluated only once. One way of
caching the answers is to evaluate <strong>QH2</strong> first of all and
substitute the list of answers for <strong>QH2</strong> in the query. Another way
is to use option <strong>cache</strong>. It is expressed like this:</p><pre><code class="">
QH2' = qlc:q([X || X &lt;- QH2], {cache, ets})</code></pre><p>or only</p><pre><code class="">
QH2' = qlc:q([X || X &lt;- QH2], cache)</code></pre><p>The effect of option <strong>cache</strong> is that when
generator <strong>QH2'</strong> is run the first time, every answer is stored in
an ETS table. When the next answer of <strong>QH1</strong> is tried,
answers to <strong>QH2'</strong>
are copied from the ETS table, which is very fast. As for
option <strong>unique</strong> the cost is a possibly substantial amount
of RAM memory.</p><p>Option <strong>{cache,Â list}</strong> offers the
possibility to store the answers in a list on the process heap.
This has the potential of being faster than ETS tables,
as there is no need to copy answers from the table. However, it can
often result in slower evaluation because of more garbage
collections of the process heap and increased RAM memory
consumption because of larger heaps. Another drawback with cache
lists is that if the list size exceeds a limit, a
temporary file is used. Reading the answers from a file is
much slower than copying them from an ETS table. But if the
available RAM memory is scarce, setting the <a href="#max_list_size">limit</a> to some low value is an
alternative.</p><p>Option <strong>cache_all</strong> can be set to
<strong>ets</strong> or <strong>list</strong> when evaluating a query. It adds a
<strong>cache</strong> or <strong>{cache,Â list}</strong> option to every list
expression except QLC tables and lists on all levels of the
query. This can be used for testing if caching would improve
efficiency at all. If the answer is yes, further testing is
needed to pinpoint the generators that are to be cached.</p><a name="implementing_a_qlc_table"></a><h3>Implementing a QLC Table</h3><p>As an example of

            []
    end.</code></pre><p><strong>TF</strong> is the traversal function. The <strong>qlc</strong> module
requires that there is a way of traversing all objects of the
data structure. <strong>gb_trees</strong> has an iterator function
suitable for that purpose. Notice that for each object returned, a
new fun is created. As long as the list is not terminated by
<strong>[]</strong>, it is assumed that the tail of the list is a nullary
function and that calling the function returns further objects
(and functions).</p><p>The lookup function is optional. It is assumed that the lookup
function always finds values much faster than it would take to
traverse the table. The first argument is the position of the
key. As <strong>qlc_next/1</strong> returns the objects as <strong>{Key,Â Value}</strong>
pairs, the position is 1. Notice that the lookup function is to return
<strong>{Key,Â Value}</strong> pairs, as the traversal function does.</p><p>The format function is also optional. It is called by
<a href="#info/1">info/1</a>
to give feedback at runtime of how the query
is to be evaluated. Try to give as good feedback as
possible without showing too much details. In the example, at
most seven objects of the table are shown. The format function
handles two cases: <strong>all</strong> means that all objects of the
table are traversed; <strong>{lookup,Â 1,Â KeyValues}</strong>
means that the lookup function is used for looking up key
values.</p><p>Whether the whole table is traversed or only some keys
looked up depends on how the query is expressed. If the query has
the form</p><pre><code class="">
qlc:q([T || P &lt;- LE, F])</code></pre><p>and <strong>P</strong> is a tuple, the <strong>qlc</strong> module analyzes
<strong>P</strong> and <strong>F</strong> in
compile time to find positions of tuple <strong>P</strong> that are tested
for equality to constants. If such a position at runtime turns
out to be the key position, the lookup function can be used,
otherwise all objects of the table must be traversed.
The info function <strong>InfoFun</strong> returns the key position.
There can be indexed positions as well, also returned by the
info function. An index is an extra table that makes lookup on
some position fast. Mnesia maintains indexes upon request,
and introduces so called secondary keys. The <strong>qlc</strong>
module prefers to look up objects using the key before secondary
keys regardless of the number of constants to look up.</p><h3>Key Equality</h3><p>Erlang/OTP has two operators for testing term equality: <strong>==/2</strong>
and <strong>=:=/2</strong>. The difference is all about the integers that can be
represented by floats. For example, <strong>2 == 2.0</strong> evaluates to
<strong>true</strong> while <strong>2 =:= 2.0</strong> evaluates to <strong>false</strong>.
Normally this is a minor issue, but the <strong>qlc</strong> module cannot
ignore the difference, which affects the user's choice of
operators in QLCs.</p><p>If the <strong>qlc</strong> module at compile time can determine that some
constant is free of integers, it does not matter which one of
<strong>==/2</strong> or <strong>=:=/2</strong> is used:</p><pre>
1&gt; <span class="input">E1 = ets:new(t, [set]), % uses =:=/2 for key equality</span>
<span class="input">Q1 = qlc:q([K ||</span>
<span class="input">{K} &lt;- ets:table(E1),</span>
<span class="input">K == 2.71 orelse K == a]),</span>
<span class="input">io:format("~s~n", [qlc:info(Q1)]).</span>
ets:match_spec_run(
       lists:flatmap(fun(V) -&gt;
			    ets:lookup(#Ref&lt;0.3098908599.2283929601.256025&gt;,
				       V)
		     end,
		     [a, 2.71]),
       ets:match_spec_compile([{{'$1'}, [], ['$1']}]))</pre><p>In the example, operator <strong>==/2</strong> has been handled
exactly as <strong>=:=/2</strong> would have been handled. However,
if it cannot be determined at compile time that some
constant is free of integers, and the table uses <strong>=:=/2</strong>
when comparing keys for equality (see option <a href="#key_equality">key_equality</a>), then the
<strong>qlc</strong> module does not try to look up the constant. The
reason is that there is in the general case no upper limit on
the number of key values that can compare equal to such a
constant; every combination of integers and floats must be
looked up:</p><pre>
2&gt; <span class="input">E2 = ets:new(t, [set]),</span>
<span class="input">true = ets:insert(E2, [{{2,2},a},{{2,2.0},b},{{2.0,2},c}]),</span>

             [{{'$1', '$2'}, [{'==', '$1', {const, {2, 2}}}], ['$2']}]}}])
3&gt; <span class="input">lists:sort(qlc:e(Q2)).</span>
[a,b,c]</pre><p>Looking up only <strong>{2,2}</strong> would not return <strong>b</strong> and
<strong>c</strong>.</p><p>If the table uses <strong>==/2</strong> when comparing keys for equality,
the <strong>qlc</strong> module looks up the constant regardless of
which operator is used in the QLC. However, <strong>==/2</strong> is to
be preferred:</p><pre>
4&gt; <span class="input">E3 = ets:new(t, [ordered_set]), % uses ==/2 for key equality</span>
<span class="input">true = ets:insert(E3, [{{2,2.0},b}]),</span>
<span class="input">F3 = fun(I) -&gt;</span>

[b]</pre><p>Lookup join is handled analogously to lookup of constants in a
table: if the join operator is <strong>==/2</strong>, and the table where
constants are to be looked up uses <strong>=:=/2</strong> when testing
keys for equality, then the <strong>qlc</strong> module does not consider
lookup join for that table.</p><h2>Data Types</h2><span class="name">abstract_expr</span><p>Parse trees for Erlang expression, see section <a href="./absform">The Abstract Format</a>

maximum number of answers returned. Defaults to
<strong>10</strong>. If less than the requested number of answers is

return <strong>[]</strong>.</p><h3>q/1</h3><h3>q/2</h3><p>Return a handle for a query list comprehension.</p><p>Returns a query handle for a QLC.
The QLC must be the first argument to this function, otherwise
it is evaluated as an ordinary list comprehension. It is also
necessary to add the following line to the source code:</p><pre><code class="">
-include_lib("stdlib/include/qlc.hrl").</code></pre><p>This causes a parse transform to substitute a fun for the QLC. The
(compiled) fun is called when the query handle is evaluated.</p><p>When calling <strong>qlc:q/1,2</strong> from the Erlang shell, the
parse transform is automatically called. When this occurs, the fun
substituted for the QLC is not compiled but is evaluated by
<a href="erl_eval">erl_eval</a>. This
is also true when expressions are evaluated by
<strong>file:eval/1,2</strong> or in the debugger.</p><p>To be explicit, this does not work:</p><pre>
...
A = [X || {X} &lt;- [{1},{2}]],
QH = qlc:q(A),
...</pre><p>Variable <strong>A</strong> is bound to the evaluated value
of the list comprehension (<strong>[1,2]</strong>). The compiler
complains with an error message ("argument is not a query
list comprehension"); the shell process stops with a
<strong>badarg</strong> reason.</p><p><strong>q(<span class="anno">QLC</span>)</strong> is equivalent to
<strong>q(<span class="anno">QLC</span>, [])</strong>.</p><p>Options:</p><ul><li> <p>Option <strong>{cache,Â ets}</strong> can be used to cache
the answers to a QLC. The answers are stored in one ETS
table for each cached QLC. When a cached QLC is
evaluated again, answers are fetched from the table without
any further computations. Therefore, when all answers to a
cached QLC have been found, the ETS tables used for
caching answers to the qualifiers of the QLC can be emptied.
Option <strong>cache</strong> is equivalent to <strong>{cache,Â ets}</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p>Option <strong>{cache,Â list}</strong> can be used to cache
the answers to a QLC like
<strong>{cache,Â ets}</strong>. The difference is that the answers
are kept in a list (on the process heap). If the answers
would occupy more than a certain amount of RAM memory, a
temporary file is used for storing the answers. Option
<strong>max_list_size</strong> sets the limit in bytes and the temporary
file is put on the directory set by option <strong>tmpdir</strong>.</p> <p>Option <strong>cache</strong> has no effect if it is known that
the QLC is to be evaluated at most once.
This is always true for the top-most QLC
and also for the list expression of the first
generator in a list of qualifiers. Notice that in the presence
of side effects in filters or callback functions, the answers
to QLCs can be affected by option <strong>cache</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p>Option <strong>{unique,Â true}</strong> can be used to remove
duplicate answers to a QLC. The unique
answers are stored in one ETS table for each QLC.
The table is emptied every time it is known
that there are no more answers to the QLC.
Option <strong>unique</strong> is equivalent to
<strong>{unique,Â true}</strong>. If option <strong>unique</strong> is
combined with option <strong>{cache,Â ets}</strong>, two ETS
tables are used, but the full answers are stored in one
table only. If option <strong>unique</strong> is combined with option
<strong>{cache,Â list}</strong>, the answers are sorted
twice using
<a href="#keysort/3">keysort/3</a>;
once to remove duplicates and once to restore the order.</p> </li></ul><p>Options <strong>cache</strong> and <strong>unique</strong> apply not only
to the QLC itself but also to the results of looking up constants,
running match specifications, and joining handles.</p><p><em>Example:</em></p><p>In the following example the cached results of the merge join are
traversed for each value of <strong>A</strong>. Notice that without option
<strong>cache</strong> the join would have been carried out
three times, once for each value of <strong>A</strong>.</p><pre>

In Erlang/OTP there is support for ETS, Dets, and
Mnesia tables, but many other data structures can be turned
into QLC tables. This is accomplished by letting function(s) in the
module implementing the data structure create a query handle by
calling <strong>qlc:table/2</strong>. The different ways to traverse the table
and properties of the table are handled by callback
functions provided as options to <strong>qlc:table/2</strong>.</p><ul><li> <p>Callback function <strong><span class="anno">TraverseFun</span></strong> is
used for traversing the table. It is to return a list of

table. Any other return value is immediately returned as
value of the query evaluation. Unary
<strong><span class="anno">TraverseFun</span></strong>s are to accept a match
specification as argument. The match specification is
created by the parse transform by analyzing the pattern of
the generator calling <strong>qlc:table/2</strong> and filters using

the value returned by <strong><span class="anno">ParentFun</span></strong>, or

in an efficient manner.All functions fail with reason <strong>badarg</strong> if arguments
are of wrong type, for example, queue arguments are not
queues, indexes are not integers, and list arguments are
not lists. Improper lists cause internal crashes.
An index out of range for a queue also causes
a failure with reason <strong>badarg</strong>.Some functions, where noted, fail with reason <strong>empty</strong>
for an empty queue.The data representing a queue as used by this module
is to be regarded as opaque by other modules. Any code
assuming knowledge of the format is running on thin ice.All operations has an amortized O(1) running time, except
<a href="#filter/2">filter/2</a>,
<a href="#join/2">join/2</a>,
<a href="#len/1">len/1</a>,
<a href="#member/2">member/2</a>,
<a href="#split/2">split/2</a> that have O(n).
To minimize the size of a queue minimizing
the amount of garbage built by queue operations, the queues
do not contain explicit length information, and that is
why <strong>len/1</strong> is O(n). If better performance for this
particular operation is essential, it is easy for
the caller to keep track of the length.Queues are double-ended. The mental picture of
a queue is a line of people (items) waiting for
their turn. The queue front is the end with the item
that has waited the longest. The queue rear is the end
an item enters when it starts to wait. If instead using
the mental picture of a list, the front is called head
and the rear is called tail.Entering at the front and exiting at the rear
are reverse operations on the queue.This module has three sets of interface functions: the
"Original API", the "Extended API", and the "Okasaki API".The "Original API" and the "Extended API" both use the
mental picture of a waiting line of items. Both
have reverse operations suffixed "_r".The "Original API" item removal functions return compound
terms with both the removed item and the resulting queue.
The "Extended API" contains alternative functions that build
less garbage and functions for just inspecting the
queue ends. Also the "Okasaki API" functions build less garbage.The "Okasaki API" is inspired by "Purely Functional Data Structures"
by Chris Okasaki. It regards queues as lists.
This API is by many regarded as strange and avoidable.
For example, many reverse operations have lexically reversed names,
some with more readable but perhaps less understandable aliases.</p><h3>Original API</h3><h2>Data Types</h2><span class="name">queue</span><p>As returned by

This module provides a pseudo random number generator.
The module contains a number of algorithms.
The uniform distribution algorithms are based on the
<a href="http://xorshift.di.unimi.it"> Xoroshiro and Xorshift algorithms </a>
by Sebastiano Vigna.
The normal distribution algorithm uses the
<a href="http://www.jstatsoft.org/v05/i08"> Ziggurat Method by Marsaglia and Tsang </a>
on top of the uniform distribution algorithm.

For most algorithms, jump functions are provided for generating
non-overlapping sequences for parallel computations.
The jump functions perform calculations
equivalent to perform a large number of repeated calls
for calculating new states.
The following algorithms are provided:<dl><dt><strong>exsss</strong></dt><dd> <p>Xorshift116**, 58 bits precision and period of 2^116-1</p> <p>Jump function: equivalent to 2^64 calls</p> <p>
This is the Xorshift116 generator combined with the StarStar scrambler
from the 2018 paper by David Blackman and Sebastiano Vigna:
<a href="http://vigna.di.unimi.it/ftp/papers/ScrambledLinear.pdf"> Scrambled Linear Pseudorandom Number Generators </a>
</p> <p>
The generator does not need 58-bit rotates so it is faster
than the Xoroshiro116 generator, and when combined with
the StarStar scrambler it does not have any weak low bits
like <strong>exrop</strong> (Xoroshiro116+).
</p> <p>
Alas, this combination is about 10% slower than <strong>exrop</strong>,
but is despite that the default algorithm thanks to its
statistical qualities.
</p> </dd><dt><strong>exro928ss</strong></dt><dd> <p>Xoroshiro928**, 58 bits precision and a period of 2^928-1</p> <p>Jump function: equivalent to 2^512 calls</p> <p>
This is a 58 bit version of Xoroshiro1024**,
from the 2018 paper by David Blackman and Sebastiano Vigna:
<a href="http://vigna.di.unimi.it/ftp/papers/ScrambledLinear.pdf"> Scrambled Linear Pseudorandom Number Generators </a>
that on a 64 bit Erlang system executes only about 40% slower than
the default <strong>exsss</strong> algorithm but with much longer period
and better statistical properties, and on the flip side
a larger state.
</p> <p>
Many thanks to Sebastiano Vigna for his help with
the 58 bit adaption.
</p> </dd><dt><strong>exrop</strong></dt><dd> <p>Xoroshiro116+, 58 bits precision and period of 2^116-1</p> <p>Jump function: equivalent to 2^64 calls</p> </dd><dt><strong>exs1024s</strong></dt><dd> <p>Xorshift1024*, 64 bits precision and a period of 2^1024-1</p> <p>Jump function: equivalent to 2^512 calls</p> </dd><dt><strong>exsp</strong></dt><dd> <p>Xorshift116+, 58 bits precision and period of 2^116-1</p> <p>Jump function: equivalent to 2^64 calls</p> <p>
This is a corrected version of the previous default algorithm,
that now has been superseded by Xoroshiro116+ (<strong>exrop</strong>).
Since there is no native 58 bit rotate instruction this
algorithm executes a little (say &lt; 15%) faster than <strong>exrop</strong>.
See the 
<a href="http://xorshift.di.unimi.it">algorithms' homepage</a>.
</p> </dd></dl>
The default algorithm is <strong>exsss</strong> (Xorshift116**).
If a specific algorithm is
required, ensure to always use <a href="#seed-1">seed-1</a> to initialize the state.

Undocumented (old) algorithms are deprecated but still implemented
so old code relying on them will produce
the same pseudo random sequences as before.
Every time a random number is requested, a state is used to
calculate it and a new state is produced. The state can either be
implicit or be an explicit argument and return value.The functions with implicit state use the process dictionary
variable <strong>rand_seed</strong> to remember the current state.If a process calls
<a href="#uniform-0">uniform-0</a>,
<a href="#uniform-1">uniform-1</a> or
<a href="#uniform_real-0">uniform_real-0</a> without
setting a seed first, <a href="#seed-1">seed-1</a>
is called automatically with the default algorithm and creates a
non-constant seed.The functions with explicit state never use the process dictionary.<em>Examples:</em>Simple use; creates and seeds the default algorithm
with a non-constant seed if not already done:<pre>
R0 = rand:uniform(),
R1 = rand:uniform(),</pre>Use a specified algorithm:<pre>
_ = rand:seed(exs928ss),
R2 = rand:uniform(),</pre>Use a specified algorithm with a constant seed:<pre>
_ = rand:seed(exs928ss, {123, 123534, 345345}),
R3 = rand:uniform(),</pre>Use the functional API with a non-constant seed:<pre>
S0 = rand:seed_s(exsss),
{R4, S1} = rand:uniform_s(S0),</pre>Textbook basic form Box-Muller standard normal deviate<pre>
R5 = rand:uniform_real(),
R6 = rand:uniform(),
SND0 = math:sqrt(-2 * math:log(R5)) * math:cos(math:pi() * R6)</pre>Create a standard normal deviate:<pre>
{SND1, S2} = rand:normal_s(S1),</pre>Create a normal deviate with mean -3 and variance 0.5:<pre>
{ND0, S3} = rand:normal_s(-3, 0.5, S2),</pre>
For all these generators except <strong>exro928ss</strong> and <strong>exsss</strong>
the lowest bit(s) has got a slightly less
random behaviour than all other bits.
1 bit for <strong>exrop</strong> (and <strong>exsp</strong>),
and 3 bits for <strong>exs1024s</strong>.
See for example the explanation in the
<a href="http://xoroshiro.di.unimi.it/xoroshiro128plus.c"> Xoroshiro128+ </a>
generator source code:
<pre>
Beside passing BigCrush, this generator passes the PractRand test suite
up to (and included) 16TB, with the exception of binary rank tests,
which fail due to the lowest bit being an LFSR; all other bits pass all
tests. We suggest to use a sign test to extract a random Boolean value.</pre>
If this is a problem; to generate a boolean with these algorithms
use something like this:
<pre>(rand:uniform(16) &gt; 8)</pre>
And for a general range, with <strong>N = 1</strong> for <strong>exrop</strong>,
and <strong>N = 3</strong> for <strong>exs1024s</strong>:
<pre>(((rand:uniform(Range bsl N) - 1) bsr N) + 1)</pre>
The floating point generating functions in this module
waste the lowest bits when converting from an integer
so they avoid this snag.

<a href="#uniform_s-1">uniform_s-1</a>
because all bits in the mantissa are random.
This property, in combination with the fact that exactly zero

</p></div><p>
The concept implicates that the probability to get
exactly zero is extremely low; so low that this function
is in fact guaranteed to never return zero.  The smallest
number that it might return is <strong>DBL_MIN</strong>, which is
2.0^(-1022).
</p><p>
The value range stated at the top of this function
description is technically correct, but
<strong>0.0 =&lt; <span class="anno">X</span> &lt; 1.0</strong>
is a better description of the generated numbers'
statistical distribution.  Except that exactly 0.0
is never returned, which is not possible to observe
statistically.
</p><p>
For example; for all sub ranges
<strong>N*2.0^(-53) =&lt; X &lt; (N+1)*2.0^(-53)</strong>
where
<strong>0 =&lt; integer(N) &lt; 2.0^53</strong>
the probability is the same.
Compare that with the form of the numbers generated by
<a href="#uniform_s-1">uniform_s-1</a>.
</p><p>
Having to generate extra random bits for
small numbers costs a little performance.
This function is about 20% slower than the regular

strings and binaries.The <a href="#regexp_syntax">regular expression</a>
syntax and semantics resemble that of Perl.The matching algorithms of the library are based on the
PCRE library, but not all of the PCRE library is interfaced and
some parts of the library go beyond what PCRE offers. Currently
PCRE version 8.40 (release date 2017-01-11) is used. The sections
of the PCRE documentation that are relevant to this module are
included here.</p><h2>Data Types</h2><span class="name">mp</span><p>Opaque data type containing a compiled regular expression.
<strong>mp()</strong> is guaranteed to be a tuple() having the atom
<strong>re_pattern</strong> as its first element, to allow for matching in
guards. The arity of the tuple or the content of the other fields
can change in future Erlang/OTP releases.</p><span class="name">nl_spec</span><span class="name">compile_option</span><h2>Functions</h2><h3>version/0</h3><p>Gives the PCRE version of the system in a string format</p><p>The return of this function is a string with the PCRE version of the system that was used in the Erlang/OTP compilation.</p><h3>compile/1</h3><p>Compile a regular expression into a match program</p><p>The same as <strong>compile(<span class="anno">Regexp</span>,[])</strong></p><h3>compile/2</h3><p>Compile a regular expression into a match program.</p><p>Compiles a regular expression, with the syntax
described below, into an internal format to be used later as a
parameter to
<a href="#run/2">run/2</a> and
<a href="#run/3">run/3</a>.</p><p>Compiling the regular expression before matching is useful if
the same expression is to be used in matching against multiple
subjects during the lifetime of the program. Compiling once and
executing many times is far more efficient than compiling each
time one wants to match.</p><p>When option <strong>unicode</strong> is specified, the regular expression
is to be specified as a valid Unicode <strong>charlist()</strong>, otherwise as
any valid <strong>iodata()</strong>.</p><a name="compile_options"></a><p>Options:</p><dl><dt><strong>unicode</strong></dt><dd> <p>The regular expression is specified as a Unicode
<strong>charlist()</strong> and the resulting regular expression code is to
be run against a valid Unicode <strong>charlist()</strong> subject. Also
consider option <strong>ucp</strong> when using Unicode characters.</p> </dd><dt><strong>anchored</strong></dt><dd> <p>The pattern is forced to be "anchored", that is, it is
constrained to match only at the first matching point in the
string that is searched (the "subject string"). This effect can
also be achieved by appropriate constructs in the pattern
itself.</p> </dd><dt><strong>caseless</strong></dt><dd> <p>Letters in the pattern match both uppercase and lowercase
letters. It is equivalent to Perl option <strong>/i</strong> and can be
changed within a pattern by a <strong>(?i)</strong> option setting.
Uppercase and lowercase letters are defined as in the ISO 8859-1
character set.</p> </dd><dt><strong>dollar_endonly</strong></dt><dd> <p>A dollar metacharacter in the pattern matches only at the end of
the subject string. Without this option, a dollar also matches
immediately before a newline at the end of the string (but not
before any other newlines). This option is ignored if option
<strong>multiline</strong> is specified. There is no equivalent option in
Perl, and it cannot be set within a pattern.</p> </dd><dt><strong>dotall</strong></dt><dd> <p>A dot in the pattern matches all characters, including those
indicating newline. Without it, a dot does not match when the
current position is at a newline. This option is equivalent to
Perl option <strong>/s</strong> and it can be changed within a pattern by a
<strong>(?s)</strong> option setting. A negative class, such as <strong>[^a]</strong>,
always matches newline characters, independent of the setting of
this option.</p> </dd><dt><strong>extended</strong></dt><dd> <p>If this option is set, most white space characters in the
pattern are totally ignored except when escaped or inside a
character class. However, white space is not allowed within
sequences such as <strong>(?&gt;</strong> that introduce various
parenthesized subpatterns, nor within a numerical quantifier
such as <strong>{1,3}</strong>. However, ignorable white space is permitted
between an item and a following quantifier and between a
quantifier and a following + that indicates possessiveness.
</p> <p>White space did not used to include the VT character (code
11), because Perl did not treat this character as white space.
However, Perl changed at release 5.18, so PCRE followed at
release 8.34, and VT is now treated as white space.
</p> <p>This also causes characters between an unescaped #
outside a character class and the next newline, inclusive, to
be ignored. This is equivalent to Perl's <strong>/x</strong> option, and it
can be changed within a pattern by a <strong>(?x)</strong> option setting.
</p> <p>With this option, comments inside complicated patterns can be
included. However, notice that this applies only to data
characters. Whitespace characters can never appear within special
character sequences in a pattern, for example within sequence
<strong>(?(</strong> that introduces a conditional subpattern.</p> </dd><dt><strong>firstline</strong></dt><dd> <p>An unanchored pattern is required to match before or at the first
newline in the subject string, although the matched text can
continue over the newline.</p> </dd><dt><strong>multiline</strong></dt><dd> <p>By default, PCRE treats the subject string as consisting of a
single line of characters (even if it contains newlines). The
"start of line" metacharacter (<strong>^</strong>) matches only at the
start of the string, while the "end of line" metacharacter
(<strong>$</strong>) matches only at the end of the string, or before a
terminating newline (unless option <strong>dollar_endonly</strong> is
specified). This is the same as in Perl.</p> <p>When this option is specified, the "start of line" and "end of
line" constructs match immediately following or immediately
before internal newlines in the subject string, respectively, as
well as at the very start and end. This is equivalent to Perl
option <strong>/m</strong> and can be changed within a pattern by a
<strong>(?m)</strong> option setting. If there are no newlines in a subject
string, or no occurrences of <strong>^</strong> or <strong>$</strong> in a pattern,
setting <strong>multiline</strong> has no effect.</p> </dd><dt><strong>no_auto_capture</strong></dt><dd> <p>Disables the use of numbered capturing parentheses in the
pattern. Any opening parenthesis that is not followed by <strong>?</strong>
behaves as if it is followed by <strong>?:</strong>. Named parentheses can
still be used for capturing (and they acquire numbers in the
usual way). There is no equivalent option in Perl.</p> </dd><dt><strong>dupnames</strong></dt><dd> <p>Names used to identify capturing subpatterns need not be unique.
This can be helpful for certain types of pattern when it is known
that only one instance of the named subpattern can ever be
matched. More details of named subpatterns are provided below.</p> </dd><dt><strong>ungreedy</strong></dt><dd> <p>Inverts the "greediness" of the quantifiers so that they are not
greedy by default, but become greedy if followed by "?". It is
not compatible with Perl. It can also be set by a <strong>(?U)</strong>
option setting within the pattern.</p> </dd><dt><strong>{newline, NLSpec}</strong></dt><dd> <p>Overrides the default definition of a newline in the subject
string, which is LF (ASCII 10) in Erlang.</p> <dl><dt><strong>cr</strong></dt><dd> <p>Newline is indicated by a single character <strong>cr</strong>
(ASCII 13).</p> </dd><dt><strong>lf</strong></dt><dd> <p>Newline is indicated by a single character LF (ASCII 10), the
default.</p> </dd><dt><strong>crlf</strong></dt><dd> <p>Newline is indicated by the two-character CRLF (ASCII 13
followed by ASCII 10) sequence.</p> </dd><dt><strong>anycrlf</strong></dt><dd> <p>Any of the three preceding sequences is to be recognized.</p> </dd><dt><strong>any</strong></dt><dd> <p>Any of the newline sequences above, and the Unicode sequences
VT (vertical tab, U+000B), FF (formfeed, U+000C), NEL (next
line, U+0085), LS (line separator, U+2028), and PS (paragraph
separator, U+2029).</p> </dd></dl> </dd><dt><strong>bsr_anycrlf</strong></dt><dd> <p>Specifies specifically that \R is to match only the CR,
LF, or CRLF sequences, not the Unicode-specific newline
characters.</p> </dd><dt><strong>bsr_unicode</strong></dt><dd> <p>Specifies specifically that \R is to match all the Unicode
newline characters (including CRLF, and so on, the default).</p> </dd><dt><strong>no_start_optimize</strong></dt><dd> <p>Disables optimization that can malfunction if "Special
start-of-pattern items" are present in the regular expression. A
typical example would be when matching "DEFABC" against
"(*COMMIT)ABC", where the start optimization of PCRE would skip
the subject up to "A" and never realize that the (*COMMIT)
instruction is to have made the matching fail. This option is only
relevant if you use "start-of-pattern items", as discussed in
section <a href="#regexp_syntax_details">PCRE Regular Expression Details</a>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>ucp</strong></dt><dd> <p>Specifies that Unicode character properties are to be used when
resolving \B, \b, \D, \d, \S, \s, \W and \w. Without this flag,
only ISO Latin-1 properties are used. Using Unicode properties
hurts performance, but is semantically correct when working with
Unicode characters beyond the ISO Latin-1 range.</p> </dd><dt><strong>never_utf</strong></dt><dd> <p>Specifies that the (*UTF) and/or (*UTF8) "start-of-pattern
items" are forbidden. This flag cannot be combined with option
<strong>unicode</strong>. Useful if ISO Latin-1 patterns from an external
source are to be compiled.</p> </dd></dl><h3>inspect/2</h3><p>Inspects a compiled regular expression.</p><p>Takes a compiled regular expression and an item, and returns the
relevant data from the regular expression. The only
supported item is <strong>namelist</strong>, which returns the tuple
<strong>{namelist, [binary()]}</strong>, containing the names of all (unique)
named subpatterns in the regular expression. For example:</p><pre><code class="">

{namelist,[&lt;&lt;"B"&gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;"C"&gt;&gt;]}</code></pre><p>Notice in the second example that the duplicate name only occurs
once in the returned list, and that the list is in alphabetical order

an option to <a href="#run/3">run/3</a>.
You can therefore create a name-to-value mapping from the result of

can contain both a value specification, telling which of the captured
substrings are to be returned, and a type specification, telling how
captured substrings are to be returned (as index tuples, lists, or
binaries). The options are described in detail below.</p><p>If the capture options describe that no substring capturing is to be
done (<strong>{capture, none}</strong>), the function returns the single atom

done either by specifying <strong>none</strong> or an empty list as

(<strong>match_limit</strong> or <strong>match_limit_recursion</strong>), or a compilation
error, where the error tuple has the format <strong>{error, {compile, <span class="anno">CompileErr</span>}}</strong>. Notice that if option

as <strong>nomatch</strong>.</p><p>The following options are relevant for execution:</p><dl><dt><strong>anchored</strong></dt><dd> <p>Limits <strong>run/3</strong> to matching at the first matching
position. If a pattern was compiled with <strong>anchored</strong>, or
turned out to be anchored by virtue of its contents, it cannot
be made unanchored at matching time, hence there is no
<strong>unanchored</strong> option.</p></dd><dt><strong>global</strong></dt><dd> <p>Implements global (repetitive) search (flag <strong>g</strong> in Perl).
Each match is returned as a separate <strong>list()</strong> containing the
specific match and any matching subexpressions (or as specified
by option <strong>capture</strong>. The <strong><span class="anno">Captured</span></strong> part
of the return value is hence a <strong>list()</strong> of <strong>list()</strong>s
when this option is specified.</p> <p>The interaction of option <strong>global</strong> with a regular
expression that matches an empty string surprises some users.
When option <strong>global</strong> is specified, <strong>run/3</strong> handles
empty matches in the same way as Perl: a zero-length match at any
point is also retried with options <strong>[anchored, notempty_atstart]</strong>. If that search gives a result of length
&gt; 0, the result is included. Example:</p> <pre><code class="">

of the match is 0, we do not advance to the next position
yet.</p> </dd><dt>At offset <strong>0</strong> with <strong>[anchored, notempty_atstart]</strong></dt><dd> <p>The search is retried with options <strong>[anchored, notempty_atstart]</strong> at the same position, which does not

option is specified. If alternatives in the pattern exist, they
are tried. If all the alternatives match the empty string, the
entire match fails.</p> <p><em>Example:</em></p> <p>If the following pattern is applied to a string not beginning
with "a" or "b", it would normally match the empty string at the
start of the subject:</p> <pre><code class="">
a?b?</code></pre> <p>With option <strong>notempty</strong>, this match is invalid, so
<strong>run/3</strong> searches further into the string for occurrences of

not at the start of the subject is permitted. If the pattern is
anchored, such a match can occur only if the pattern contains
\K.</p> <p>Perl has no direct equivalent of <strong>notempty</strong> or
<strong>notempty_atstart</strong>, but it does make a special case of a
pattern match of the empty string within its split() function,
and when using modifier <strong>/g</strong>. The Perl behavior can be
emulated after matching a null string by first trying the
match again at the same offset with <strong>notempty_atstart</strong> and
<strong>anchored</strong>, and then, if that fails, by advancing the
starting offset (see below) and trying an ordinary match
again.</p> </dd><dt><strong>notbol</strong></dt><dd> <p>Specifies that the first character of the subject string is not
the beginning of a line, so the circumflex metacharacter is not
to match before it. Setting this without <strong>multiline</strong> (at
compile time) causes circumflex never to match. This option only
affects the behavior of the circumflex metacharacter. It does not
affect \A.</p> </dd><dt><strong>noteol</strong></dt><dd> <p>Specifies that the end of the subject string is not the end of a
line, so the dollar metacharacter is not to match it nor (except
in multiline mode) a newline immediately before it. Setting this
without <strong>multiline</strong> (at compile time) causes dollar never to
match. This option affects only the behavior of the dollar
metacharacter. It does not affect \Z or \z.</p> </dd><dt><strong>report_errors</strong></dt><dd> <p>Gives better control of the error handling in <strong>run/3</strong>. When
specified, compilation errors (if the regular expression is not
already compiled) and runtime errors are explicitly returned as
an error tuple.</p>  <p>The following are the possible runtime errors:</p> <dl><dt><strong>match_limit</strong></dt><dd> <p>The PCRE library sets a limit on how many times the internal
match function can be called. Defaults to 10,000,000 in the
library compiled for Erlang. If <strong>{error, match_limit}</strong>
is returned, the execution of the regular expression has
reached this limit. This is normally to be regarded as a
<strong>nomatch</strong>, which is the default return value when this
occurs, but by specifying <strong>report_errors</strong>, you are
informed when the match fails because of too many internal
calls.</p> </dd><dt><strong>match_limit_recursion</strong></dt><dd> <p>This error is very similar to <strong>match_limit</strong>, but occurs
when the internal match function of PCRE is "recursively"
called more times than the <strong>match_limit_recursion</strong> limit,
which defaults to 10,000,000 as well. Notice that as long as
the <strong>match_limit</strong>
and <strong>match_limit_default</strong> values are
kept at the default values, the <strong>match_limit_recursion</strong>
error cannot occur, as the <strong>match_limit</strong> error occurs
before that (each recursive call is also a call, but not
conversely). Both limits can however be changed, either by
setting limits directly in the regular expression string (see
section <a href="#regexp_syntax_details">PCRE Regular Eexpression Details</a>) or by specifying options to
<strong>run/3</strong>.</p> </dd></dl> <p>It is important to understand that what is referred to as
"recursion" when limiting matches is not recursion on the C stack
of the Erlang machine or on the Erlang process stack. The PCRE
version compiled into the Erlang VM uses machine "heap" memory to
store values that must be kept over recursion in regular
expression matches.</p> </dd><dt><strong>{match_limit, integer() &gt;= 0}</strong></dt><dd> <p>Limits the execution time of a match in an
implementation-specific way. It is described as follows by the
PCRE documentation:</p> <pre><code class="">
The match_limit field provides a means of preventing PCRE from using
up a vast amount of resources when running patterns that are not going
to match, but which have a very large number of possibilities in their
search trees. The classic example is a pattern that uses nested
unlimited repeats.

Internally, pcre_exec() uses a function called match(), which it calls
repeatedly (sometimes recursively). The limit set by match_limit is
imposed on the number of times this function is called during a match,
which has the effect of limiting the amount of backtracking that can
take place. For patterns that are not anchored, the count restarts

It is described as follows by the PCRE documentation:</p> <pre><code class="">
The match_limit_recursion field is similar to match_limit, but instead
of limiting the total number of times that match() is called, it
limits the depth of recursion. The recursion depth is a smaller number
than the total number of calls, because not all calls to match() are
recursive. This limit is of use only if it is set smaller than
match_limit.

Limiting the recursion depth limits the amount of machine stack that
can be used, or, when PCRE has been compiled to use memory on the heap
instead of the stack, the amount of heap memory that can be used.</code></pre> <p>The Erlang VM uses a PCRE library where heap memory is used when
regular expression match recursion occurs. This therefore limits
the use of machine heap, not C stack.</p> <p>Specifying a lower value can result in matches with deep
recursion failing, when they should have matched:</p> <pre><code class="">

the regular expression as a whole matches a large part of
the subject, but the part you are interested in is in an
explicitly captured subpattern. If the return type is

return, where index 0 is for all of the pattern, and 1 is for
the first explicit capturing subpattern in the regular
expression, and so on. When using named captured subpatterns
(see below) in the regular expression, one can use
<strong>atom()</strong>s or <strong>string()</strong>s to specify the subpatterns
to be returned. For example, consider the regular
expression:</p> <pre><code class="">
".*(abcd).*"</code></pre> <p>matched against string "ABCabcdABC", capturing only the
"abcd" part (the first explicit subpattern):</p> <pre><code class="">
re:run("ABCabcdABC",".*(abcd).*",[{capture,[1]}]).</code></pre> <p>The call gives the following result, as the first explicitly
captured subpattern is "(abcd)", matching "abcd" in the
subject, at (zero-based) position 3, of length 4:</p> <pre><code class="">
{match,[{3,4}]}</code></pre> <p>Consider the same regular expression, but with the subpattern
explicitly named 'FOO':</p> <pre><code class="">
".*(?&lt;FOO&gt;abcd).*"</code></pre> <p>With this expression, we could still give the index of the
subpattern with the following call:</p> <pre><code class="">
re:run("ABCabcdABC",".*(?&lt;FOO&gt;abcd).*",[{capture,[1]}]).</code></pre> <p>giving the same result as before. But, as the subpattern is
named, we can also specify its name in the value list:</p> <pre><code class="">
re:run("ABCabcdABC",".*(?&lt;FOO&gt;abcd).*",[{capture,['FOO']}]).</code></pre> <p>This would give the same result as the earlier examples,
namely:</p> <pre><code class="">
{match,[{3,4}]}</code></pre> <p>The values list can specify indexes or names not present in
the regular expression, in which case the return values vary
depending on the type. If the type is <strong>index</strong>, the tuple
<strong>{-1,0}</strong> is returned for values with no corresponding
subpattern in the regular expression, but for the other types
(<strong>binary</strong> and <strong>list</strong>), the values are the empty
binary or list, respectively.</p> </dd><dt><strong><span class="anno">Type</span></strong></dt><dd> <p>Optionally specifies how captured substrings are to be
returned. If omitted, the default of <strong>index</strong> is used.</p> <p><strong><span class="anno">Type</span></strong> can be one of the following:</p> <dl><dt><strong>index</strong></dt><dd> <p>Returns captured substrings as pairs of byte indexes
into the subject string and length of the matching string
in the subject (as if the subject string was flattened
with <a href="../erts/erlang#iolist_to_binary/1">erts/erlang#iolist_to_binary/1</a> or
<a href="./unicode#characters_to_binary/2">unicode#characters_to_binary/2</a> before
matching). Notice that option <strong>unicode</strong> results in
<em>byte-oriented</em> indexes in a (possibly virtual)
<em>UTF-8 encoded</em> binary. A byte index tuple
<strong>{0,2}</strong> can therefore represent one or two
characters when <strong>unicode</strong> is in effect. This can seem
counter-intuitive, but has been deemed the most effective
and useful way to do it. To return lists instead can
result in simpler code if that is desired. This return
type is the default.</p> </dd><dt><strong>list</strong></dt><dd> <p>Returns matching substrings as lists of characters
(Erlang <strong>string()</strong>s). It option <strong>unicode</strong> is
used in combination with the \C sequence in the
regular expression, a captured subpattern can contain
bytes that are not valid UTF-8 (\C matches bytes
regardless of character encoding). In that case the
<strong>list</strong> capturing can result in the same types of
tuples that
<a href="./unicode#characters_to_list/2">unicode#characters_to_list/2</a> can return,
namely three-tuples with tag <strong>incomplete</strong> or
<strong>error</strong>, the successfully converted characters and
the invalid UTF-8 tail of the conversion as a binary. The
best strategy is to avoid using the \C sequence
when capturing lists.</p> </dd><dt><strong>binary</strong></dt><dd> <p>Returns matching substrings as binaries. If option
<strong>unicode</strong> is used, these binaries are in UTF-8. If
the \C sequence is used together with
<strong>unicode</strong>, the binaries can be invalid UTF-8.</p> </dd></dl> </dd></dl> <p>In general, subpatterns that were not assigned a value in the
match are returned as the tuple <strong>{-1,0}</strong> when <strong>type</strong> is
<strong>index</strong>. Unassigned subpatterns are returned as the empty
binary or list, respectively, for other return types. Consider
the following regular expression:</p> <pre><code class="">
".*((?&lt;FOO&gt;abdd)|a(..d)).*"</code></pre> <p>There are three explicitly capturing subpatterns, where the
opening parenthesis position determines the order in the result,
hence <strong>((?&lt;FOO&gt;abdd)|a(..d))</strong> is subpattern index 1,
<strong>(?&lt;FOO&gt;abdd)</strong> is subpattern index 2, and <strong>(..d)</strong>
is subpattern index 3. When matched against the following
string:</p> <pre><code class="">
"ABCabcdABC"</code></pre> <p>the subpattern at index 2 does not match, as "abdd" is not
present in the string, but the complete pattern matches (because
of the alternative <strong>a(..d)</strong>). The subpattern at index 2 is
therefore unassigned and the default return value is:</p> <pre><code class="">
{match,[{0,10},{3,4},{-1,0},{4,3}]}</code></pre> <p>Setting the capture <strong><span class="anno">Type</span></strong> to <strong>binary</strong>
gives:</p> <pre><code class="">
{match,[&lt;&lt;"ABCabcdABC"&gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;"abcd"&gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;"bcd"&gt;&gt;]}</code></pre> <p>Here the empty binary (<strong>&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;</strong>) represents the
unassigned subpattern. In the <strong>binary</strong> case, some information
about the matching is therefore lost, as
<strong>&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;</strong> can
also be an empty string captured.</p> <p>If differentiation between empty matches and non-existing
subpatterns is necessary, use the <strong>type</strong> <strong>index</strong> and do
the conversion to the final type in Erlang code.</p> <p>When option <strong>global</strong> is speciified, the <strong>capture</strong>
specification affects each match separately, so that:</p> <pre><code class="">
re:run("cacb","c(a|b)",[global,{capture,[1],list}]).</code></pre> <p>gives</p> <pre><code class="">
{match,[["a"],["b"]]}</code></pre> </dd></dl><p>For a descriptions of options only affecting the compilation step,

running a global regular expression match and dividing the initial
string wherever a match occurs. The matching part of the string is
removed from the output.</p><p>As in <a href="#run/3">run/3</a>, an <strong>mp()</strong>
compiled with option <strong>unicode</strong> requires
<strong><span class="anno">Subject</span></strong> to be a Unicode <strong>charlist()</strong>. If
compilation is done implicitly and the <strong>unicode</strong> compilation
option is specified to this function, both the regular expression and
<strong><span class="anno">Subject</span></strong> are to be specified as valid Unicode
<strong>charlist()</strong>s.</p><p>The result is given as a list of "strings", the preferred
data type specified in option <strong>return</strong> (default
<strong>iodata</strong>).</p><p>If subexpressions are specified in the regular expression, the
matching subexpressions are returned in the resulting list as
well. For example:</p><pre><code class="">
re:split("Erlang","[ln]",[{return,list}]).</code></pre><p>gives</p><pre><code class="">
["Er","a","g"]</code></pre><p>while</p><pre><code class="">
re:split("Erlang","([ln])",[{return,list}]).</code></pre><p>gives</p><pre><code class="">
["Er","l","a","n","g"]</code></pre><p>The text matching the subexpression (marked by the parentheses in the
regular expression) is inserted in the result list where it was found.
This means that concatenating the result of a split where the whole
regular expression is a single subexpression (as in the last example)
always results in the original string.</p><p>As there is no matching subexpression for the last part in the
example (the "g"), nothing is inserted after that. To make
the group of strings and the parts matching the subexpressions more
obvious, one can use option <strong>group</strong>, which groups together the
part of the subject string with the parts matching the subexpressions
when the string was split:</p><pre><code class="">
re:split("Erlang","([ln])",[{return,list},group]).</code></pre><p>gives</p><pre><code class="">
[["Er","l"],["a","n"],["g"]]</code></pre><p>Here the regular expression first matched the "l",
causing "Er" to be the first part in the result. When
the regular expression matched, the (only) subexpression was
bound to the "l", so the "l" is inserted
in the group together with "Er". The next match is of
the "n", making "a" the next part to be
returned. As the subexpression is bound to substring
"n" in this case, the "n" is inserted into
this group. The last group consists of the remaining string,
as no more matches are found.</p><p>By default, all parts of the string, including the empty strings,
are returned from the function, for example:</p><pre><code class="">
re:split("Erlang","[lg]",[{return,list}]).</code></pre><p>gives</p><pre><code class="">
["Er","an",[]]</code></pre><p>as the matching of the "g" in the end of the string
leaves an empty rest, which is also returned. This behavior
differs from the default behavior of the split function in
Perl, where empty strings at the end are by default removed. To
get the "trimming" default behavior of Perl, specify
<strong>trim</strong> as an option:</p><pre><code class="">
re:split("Erlang","[lg]",[{return,list},trim]).</code></pre><p>gives</p><pre><code class="">
["Er","an"]</code></pre><p>The "trim" option says; "give me as many parts as
possible except the empty ones", which sometimes can be
useful. You can also specify how many parts you want, by specifying
<strong>{parts,</strong>N<strong>}</strong>:</p><pre><code class="">
re:split("Erlang","[lg]",[{return,list},{parts,2}]).</code></pre><p>gives</p><pre><code class="">
["Er","ang"]</code></pre><p>Notice that the last part is "ang", not
"an", as splitting was specified into two parts,
and the splitting stops when enough parts are given, which is
why the result differs from that of <strong>trim</strong>.</p><p>More than three parts are not possible with this indata, so</p><pre><code class="">
re:split("Erlang","[lg]",[{return,list},{parts,4}]).</code></pre><p>gives the same result as the default, which is to be
viewed as "an infinite number of parts".</p><p>Specifying <strong>0</strong> as the number of parts gives the same
effect as option <strong>trim</strong>. If subexpressions are
captured, empty subexpressions matched at the end are also
stripped from the result if <strong>trim</strong> or <strong>{parts,0}</strong> is
specified.</p><p>The <strong>trim</strong> behavior corresponds exactly to the Perl default.
<strong>{parts,N}</strong>, where N is a positive integer, corresponds
exactly to the Perl behavior with a positive numerical third
parameter. The default behavior of <strong>split/3</strong> corresponds
to the Perl behavior when a negative integer is specified as
the third parameter for the Perl routine.</p><p>Summary of options not previously described for function
<strong>run/3</strong>:</p><dl><dt><strong>{return,<span class="anno">ReturnType</span>}</strong></dt><dd> <p>Specifies how the parts of the original string are presented in

are described in its own documentation, and regular expressions in general
are covered in many books, some with copious examples.
Jeffrey Friedl's "Mastering Regular Expressions", published by O'Reilly,
covers regular expressions in great detail. This description of the PCRE
regular expressions is intended as reference material.</p><p>The reference material is divided into the following sections:</p><ul><li><a href="#sect1">Special Start-of-Pattern Items</a> </li><li><a href="#sect2">Characters and Metacharacters</a> </li><li><a href="#sect3">Backslash</a></li><li><a href="#sect4">Circumflex and Dollar</a></li><li><a href="#sect5">Full Stop (Period, Dot) and \N</a> </li><li><a href="#sect6">Matching a Single Data Unit</a> </li><li><a href="#sect7">Square Brackets and Character Classes</a></li><li><a href="#sect8">Posix Character Classes</a></li><li><a href="#sect9">Vertical Bar</a></li><li><a href="#sect10">Internal Option Setting</a></li><li><a href="#sect11">Subpatterns</a></li><li><a href="#sect12">Duplicate Subpattern Numbers</a> </li><li><a href="#sect13">Named Subpatterns</a></li><li><a href="#sect14">Repetition</a></li><li><a href="#sect15">Atomic Grouping and Possessive Quantifiers</a></li><li><a href="#sect16">Back References</a></li><li><a href="#sect17">Assertions</a></li><li><a href="#sect18">Conditional Subpatterns</a></li><li><a href="#sect19">Comments</a></li><li><a href="#sect20">Recursive Patterns</a></li><li><a href="#sect21">Subpatterns as Subroutines</a> </li><li><a href="#sect22">Oniguruma Subroutine Syntax</a> </li><li><a href="#sect23">Backtracking Control</a></li></ul><a name="sect1"></a><h3>Special Start-of-Pattern Items</h3><p>Some options that can be passed to <a href="#compile/2">compile/2</a> can also be set by special items at the start
of a pattern. These are not Perl-compatible, but are provided to make
these options accessible to pattern writers who are not able to change
the program that processes the pattern. Any number of these items can
appear, but they must all be together right at the start of the
pattern string, and the letters must be in upper case.</p><p><em>UTF Support</em></p><p>Unicode support is basically UTF-8 based. To use Unicode characters, you
either call <a href="#compile/2">compile/2</a> or
<a href="#run/3">run/3</a> with option
<strong>unicode</strong>, or the pattern must start with one of these special
sequences:</p><pre><code class="">
(*UTF8)
(*UTF)</code></pre><p>Both options give the same effect, the input string is interpreted as
UTF-8. Notice that with these instructions, the automatic conversion of
lists to UTF-8 is not performed by the <strong>re</strong> functions. Therefore,
using these sequences is not recommended.
Add option <strong>unicode</strong> when running
<a href="#compile/2">compile/2</a> instead.</p><p>Some applications that allow their users to supply patterns can wish to
restrict them to non-UTF data for security reasons. If option
<strong>never_utf</strong> is set at compile time, (*UTF), and so on, are not
allowed, and their appearance causes an error.</p><p><em>Unicode Property Support</em></p><p>The following is another special sequence that can appear at the start of
a pattern:</p><pre><code class="">
(*UCP)</code></pre><p>This has the same effect as setting option <strong>ucp</strong>: it causes
sequences such as \d and \w to use Unicode properties to
determine character types, instead of recognizing only characters with
codes &lt; 256 through a lookup table.</p><p><em>Disabling Startup Optimizations</em></p><p>If a pattern starts with <strong>(*NO_START_OPT)</strong>,
it has the same effect as
setting option <strong>no_start_optimize</strong> at compile time.</p><p><em>Newline Conventions</em></p><a name="newline_conventions"></a><p>PCRE supports five conventions for indicating line breaks in strings: a
single CR (carriage return) character, a single LF (line feed) character,
the two-character sequence CRLF, any of the three preceding, and any
Unicode newline sequence.</p><p>A newline convention can also be specified by starting a pattern string
with one of the following five sequences:</p><dl><dt>(*CR)</dt><dd>Carriage return</dd><dt>(*LF)</dt><dd>Line feed</dd><dt>(*CRLF)</dt><dd>&gt;Carriage return followed by line feed</dd><dt>(*ANYCRLF)</dt><dd>Any of the three above</dd><dt>(*ANY)</dt><dd>All Unicode newline sequences</dd></dl><p>These override the default and the options specified to
<a href="#compile/2">compile/2</a>. For example, the
following pattern changes the convention to CR:</p><pre><code class="">
(*CR)a.b</code></pre><p>This pattern matches <strong>a\nb</strong>, as LF is no longer a newline.
If more than one of them is present, the last one is used.</p><p>The newline convention affects where the circumflex and dollar assertions
are true. It also affects the interpretation of the dot metacharacter when
<strong>dotall</strong> is not set, and the behavior of \N. However, it does not
affect what the \R escape sequence matches. By default, this is any
Unicode newline sequence, for Perl compatibility. However, this can be
changed; see the description of \R in section
<a href="#newline_sequences">Newline Sequences</a>. A change
of the \R setting can be combined with a change of the newline
convention.</p><p><em>Setting Match and Recursion Limits</em></p><p>The caller of <a href="#run/3">run/3</a> can set a
limit on the number of times the internal match() function is called and
on the maximum depth of recursive calls. These facilities are provided to
catch runaway matches that are provoked by patterns with huge matching
trees (a typical example is a pattern with nested unlimited repeats) and
to avoid running out of system stack by too much recursion. When one of
these limits is reached, <strong>pcre_exec()</strong> gives an error return. The
limits can also be set by items at the start of the pattern of the
following forms:</p><pre><code class="">
(*LIMIT_MATCH=d)
(*LIMIT_RECURSION=d)</code></pre><p>Here d is any number of decimal digits. However, the value of the setting
must be less than the value set by the caller of <strong>run/3</strong> for it to
have any effect. That is, the pattern writer can lower the limit set by
the programmer, but not raise it. If there is more than one setting of one
of these limits, the lower value is used.</p><p>The default value for both the limits is 10,000,000 in the Erlang
VM. Notice that the recursion limit does not affect the stack depth of the
VM, as PCRE for Erlang is compiled in such a way that the match function
never does recursion on the C stack.</p><p>Note that <strong>LIMIT_MATCH</strong> and <strong>LIMIT_RECURSION</strong> can only reduce
the value of the limits set by the caller, not increase them.</p><a name="sect2"></a><h3>Characters and Metacharacters</h3><p>A regular expression is a pattern that is matched against a subject
string from left to right. Most characters stand for themselves in a
pattern and match the corresponding characters in the subject. As a
trivial example, the following pattern matches a portion of a subject
string that is identical to itself:</p><pre><code class="">
The quick brown fox</code></pre><p>When caseless matching is specified (option <strong>caseless</strong>), letters
are matched independently of case.</p><p>The power of regular expressions comes from the ability to include
alternatives and repetitions in the pattern. These are encoded in the
pattern by the use of <em>metacharacters</em>, which do not stand for
themselves but instead are interpreted in some special way.</p><p>Two sets of metacharacters exist: those that are recognized anywhere in
the pattern except within square brackets, and those that are recognized
within square brackets. Outside square brackets, the metacharacters are
as follows:</p><dl><dt>\</dt><dd>General escape character with many uses</dd><dt>^</dt><dd>Assert start of string (or line, in multiline mode) </dd><dt>$</dt><dd>Assert end of string (or line, in multiline mode)</dd><dt>.</dt><dd>Match any character except newline (by default)</dd><dt>[</dt><dd>Start character class definition</dd><dt>|</dt><dd>Start of alternative branch</dd><dt>(</dt><dd>Start subpattern</dd><dt>)</dt><dd>End subpattern</dd><dt>?</dt><dd>Extends the meaning of (, also 0 or 1 quantifier, also quantifier minimizer</dd><dt>*</dt><dd>0 or more quantifiers</dd><dt>+</dt><dd>1 or more quantifier, also "possessive quantifier" </dd><dt>{</dt><dd>Start min/max quantifier</dd></dl><p>Part of a pattern within square brackets is called a "character class".
The following are the only metacharacters in a character class:</p><dl><dt>\</dt><dd>General escape character</dd><dt>^</dt><dd>Negate the class, but only if the first character</dd><dt>-</dt><dd>Indicates character range</dd><dt>[</dt><dd>Posix character class (only if followed by Posix syntax) </dd><dt>]</dt><dd>Terminates the character class</dd></dl><p>The following sections describe the use of each metacharacter.</p><a name="sect3"></a><h3>Backslash</h3><p>The backslash character has many uses. First, if it is followed by a
character that is not a number or a letter, it takes away any special
meaning that a character can have. This use of backslash as an escape
character applies both inside and outside character classes.</p><p>For example, if you want to match a * character, you write \* in the
pattern. This escaping action applies if the following character would
otherwise be interpreted as a metacharacter, so it is always safe to
precede a non-alphanumeric with backslash to specify that it stands for
itself. In particular, if you want to match a backslash, write \\.</p><p>In <strong>unicode</strong> mode, only ASCII numbers and letters have any special
meaning after a backslash. All other characters (in particular, those
whose code points are &gt; 127) are treated as literals.</p><p>If a pattern is compiled with option <strong>extended</strong>, whitespace in the
pattern (other than in a character class) and characters between a #
outside a character class and the next newline are ignored. An escaping
backslash can be used to include a whitespace or # character as part of
the pattern.</p><p>To remove the special meaning from a sequence of characters, put them
between \Q and \E. This is different from Perl in that $ and @ are
handled as literals in \Q...\E sequences in PCRE, while $ and @ cause
variable interpolation in Perl. Notice the following examples:</p><pre><code class="">
Pattern            PCRE matches   Perl matches

\Qabc$xyz\E        abc$xyz        abc followed by the contents of $xyz
\Qabc\$xyz\E       abc\$xyz       abc\$xyz
\Qabc\E\$\Qxyz\E   abc$xyz        abc$xyz</code></pre><p>The \Q...\E sequence is recognized both inside and outside character
classes. An isolated \E that is not preceded by \Q is ignored. If \Q is
not followed by \E later in the pattern, the literal interpretation
continues to the end of the pattern (that is, \E is assumed at the end).
If the isolated \Q is inside a character class, this causes an error, as
the character class is not terminated.</p><p><em>Non-Printing Characters</em></p><a name="non_printing_characters"></a><p>A second use of backslash provides a way of encoding non-printing
characters in patterns in a visible manner. There is no restriction on the
appearance of non-printing characters, apart from the binary zero that
terminates a pattern. When a pattern is prepared by text editing, it is
often easier to use one of the following escape sequences than the binary
character it represents:</p><dl><dt>\a</dt><dd>Alarm, that is, the BEL character (hex 07)</dd><dt>\cx</dt><dd>"Control-x", where x is any ASCII character</dd><dt>\e</dt><dd>Escape (hex 1B)</dd><dt>\f</dt><dd>Form feed (hex 0C)</dd><dt>\n</dt><dd>Line feed (hex 0A)</dd><dt>\r</dt><dd>Carriage return (hex 0D)</dd><dt>\t</dt><dd>Tab (hex 09)</dd><dt>\0dd</dt><dd>Character with octal code 0dd</dd><dt>\ddd</dt><dd>Character with octal code ddd, or back reference </dd><dt>\o{ddd..}</dt><dd>character with octal code ddd..</dd><dt>\xhh</dt><dd>Character with hex code hh</dd><dt>\x{hhh..}</dt><dd>Character with hex code hhh..</dd></dl><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>Note that \0dd is always an octal code, and that \8 and \9 are
the literal characters "8" and "9".</p></div><p>The precise effect of \cx on ASCII characters is as follows: if x is a
lowercase letter, it is converted to upper case. Then bit 6 of the
character (hex 40) is inverted. Thus \cA to \cZ become hex 01 to hex 1A
(A is 41, Z is 5A), but \c{ becomes hex 3B ({ is 7B), and \c; becomes
hex 7B (; is 3B). If the data item (byte or 16-bit value) following \c
has a value &gt; 127, a compile-time error occurs. This locks out
non-ASCII characters in all modes.</p><p>The \c facility was designed for use with ASCII characters, but with the
extension to Unicode it is even less useful than it once was.</p><p>After \0 up to two further octal digits are read. If there are fewer than
two digits, just those that are present are used. Thus the sequence
\0\x\015 specifies two binary zeros followed by a CR character (code value
13). Make sure you supply two digits after the initial zero if the pattern
character that follows is itself an octal digit.</p><p>The escape \o must be followed by a sequence of octal digits, enclosed
in braces. An error occurs if this is not the case. This escape is a recent
addition to Perl; it provides way of specifying character code points as
octal numbers greater than 0777, and it also allows octal numbers and back
references to be unambiguously specified.</p><p>For greater clarity and unambiguity, it is best to avoid following \ by
a digit greater than zero. Instead, use \o{} or \x{} to specify character
numbers, and \g{} to specify back references. The following paragraphs
describe the old, ambiguous syntax.</p><p>The handling of a backslash followed by a digit other than 0 is
complicated, and Perl has changed in recent releases, causing PCRE also
to change. Outside a character class, PCRE reads the digit and any following
digits as a decimal number. If the number is &lt; 8, or if there have
been at least that many previous capturing left parentheses in the
expression, the entire sequence is taken as a <em>back reference</em>. A
description of how this works is provided later, following the discussion
of parenthesized subpatterns.</p><p>Inside a character class, or if the decimal number following \ is &gt;
7 and there have not been that many capturing subpatterns, PCRE handles
\8 and \9 as the literal characters "8" and "9", and otherwise re-reads
up to three octal digits following the backslash, and using them to
generate a data character. Any subsequent digits stand for themselves.
For example:</p><dl><dt>\040</dt><dd>Another way of writing an ASCII space</dd><dt>\40</dt><dd>The same, provided there are &lt; 40 previous capturing subpatterns</dd><dt>\7</dt><dd>Always a back reference</dd><dt>\11</dt><dd>Can be a back reference, or another way of writing a tab</dd><dt>\011</dt><dd>Always a tab</dd><dt>\0113</dt><dd>A tab followed by character "3"</dd><dt>\113</dt><dd>Can be a back reference, otherwise the character with octal code 113 </dd><dt>\377</dt><dd>Can be a back reference, otherwise value 255 (decimal)</dd><dt>\81</dt><dd>Either a back reference, or the two characters "8" and "1"</dd></dl><p>Notice that octal values &gt;= 100 that are specified using this syntax
must not be introduced by a leading zero, as no more than three octal digits
are ever read.</p><p>By default, after \x that is not followed by {, from zero to two
hexadecimal digits are read (letters can be in upper or lower case). Any
number of hexadecimal digits may appear between \x{ and }. If a character
other than a hexadecimal digit appears between \x{ and }, or if there is no
terminating }, an error occurs.
</p><p>Characters whose value is less than 256 can be defined by either of the
two syntaxes for \x. There is no difference in the way they are handled. For
example, \xdc is exactly the same as \x{dc}.</p><p><em>Constraints on character values</em></p><p>Characters that are specified using octal or hexadecimal numbers are
limited to certain values, as follows:</p><dl><dt>8-bit non-UTF mode</dt><dd><p>&lt; 0x100</p></dd><dt>8-bit UTF-8 mode</dt><dd><p>&lt; 0x10ffff and a valid codepoint</p></dd></dl><p>Invalid Unicode codepoints are the range 0xd800 to 0xdfff (the
so-called "surrogate" codepoints), and 0xffef.</p><p><em>Escape sequences in character classes</em></p><p>All the sequences that define a single character value can be used both
inside and outside character classes. Also, inside a character class, \b
is interpreted as the backspace character (hex 08).</p><p>\N is not allowed in a character class. \B, \R, and \X are not special
inside a character class. Like other unrecognized escape sequences, they
are treated as the literal characters "B", "R", and "X". Outside a
character class, these sequences have different meanings.</p><p><em>Unsupported Escape Sequences</em></p><p>In Perl, the sequences \l, \L, \u, and \U are recognized by its string
handler and used to modify the case of following characters. PCRE does not
support these escape sequences.</p><p><em>Absolute and Relative Back References</em></p><p>The sequence \g followed by an unsigned or a negative number, optionally
enclosed in braces, is an absolute or relative back reference. A named
back reference can be coded as \g{name}. Back references are discussed
later, following the discussion of parenthesized subpatterns.</p><p><em>Absolute and Relative Subroutine Calls</em></p><p>For compatibility with Oniguruma, the non-Perl syntax \g followed by a
name or a number enclosed either in angle brackets or single quotes, is
alternative syntax for referencing a subpattern as a "subroutine".
Details are discussed later. Notice that \g{...} (Perl syntax) and
\g&lt;...&gt; (Oniguruma syntax) are <em>not</em> synonymous. The former
is a back reference and the latter is a subroutine call.</p><p><em>Generic Character Types</em></p><a name="generic_character_types"></a><p>Another use of backslash is for specifying generic character types:</p><dl><dt>\d</dt><dd>Any decimal digit</dd><dt>\D</dt><dd>Any character that is not a decimal digit</dd><dt>\h</dt><dd>Any horizontal whitespace character</dd><dt>\H</dt><dd>Any character that is not a horizontal whitespace character</dd><dt>\s</dt><dd>Any whitespace character</dd><dt>\S</dt><dd>Any character that is not a whitespace character </dd><dt>\v</dt><dd>Any vertical whitespace character</dd><dt>\V</dt><dd>Any character that is not a vertical whitespace character</dd><dt>\w</dt><dd>Any "word" character</dd><dt>\W</dt><dd>Any "non-word" character</dd></dl><p>There is also the single sequence \N, which matches a non-newline
character. This is the same as the "." metacharacter when <strong>dotall</strong>
is not set. Perl also uses \N to match characters by name, but PCRE does
not support this.</p><p>Each pair of lowercase and uppercase escape sequences partitions the
complete set of characters into two disjoint sets. Any given character
matches one, and only one, of each pair. The sequences can appear both
inside and outside character classes. They each match one character of the
appropriate type. If the current matching point is at the end of the
subject string, all fail, as there is no character to match.</p><p>For compatibility with Perl, \s did not used to match the VT character (code
11), which made it different from the the POSIX "space" class. However, Perl
added VT at release 5.18, and PCRE followed suit at release 8.34. The default
\s characters are now HT (9), LF (10), VT (11), FF (12), CR (13), and space
(32), which are defined as white space in the "C" locale. This list may vary if
locale-specific matching is taking place. For example, in some locales the
"non-breaking space" character (\xA0) is recognized as white space, and in
others the VT character is not.</p><p>A "word" character is an underscore or any character that is a letter or
a digit. By default, the definition of letters and digits is controlled by
the PCRE low-valued character tables, in Erlang's case (and without option
<strong>unicode</strong>), the ISO Latin-1 character set.</p><p>By default, in <strong>unicode</strong> mode, characters with values &gt; 255, that
is, all characters outside the ISO Latin-1 character set, never match \d,
\s, or \w, and always match \D, \S, and \W. These sequences retain their
original meanings from before UTF support was available, mainly for
efficiency reasons. However, if option <strong>ucp</strong> is set, the behavior is
changed so that Unicode properties are used to determine character types,
as follows:</p><dl><dt>\d</dt><dd>Any character that \p{Nd} matches (decimal digit) </dd><dt>\s</dt><dd>Any character that \p{Z} or \h or \v </dd><dt>\w</dt><dd>Any character that matches \p{L} or \p{N} matches, plus underscore</dd></dl><p>The uppercase escapes match the inverse sets of characters. Notice that
\d matches only decimal digits, while \w matches any Unicode digit, any
Unicode letter, and underscore. Notice also that <strong>ucp</strong> affects \b and
\B, as they are defined in terms of \w and \W. Matching these sequences is
noticeably slower when <strong>ucp</strong> is set.</p><p>The sequences \h, \H, \v, and \V are features that were added to Perl in
release 5.10. In contrast to the other sequences, which match only ASCII
characters by default, these always match certain high-valued code points,
regardless if <strong>ucp</strong> is set.</p><p>The following are the horizontal space characters:</p><dl><dt>U+0009</dt><dd>Horizontal tab (HT)</dd><dt>U+0020</dt><dd>Space</dd><dt>U+00A0</dt><dd>Non-break space</dd><dt>U+1680</dt><dd>Ogham space mark</dd><dt>U+180E</dt><dd>Mongolian vowel separator</dd><dt>U+2000</dt><dd>En quad</dd><dt>U+2001</dt><dd>Em quad</dd><dt>U+2002</dt><dd>En space</dd><dt>U+2003</dt><dd>Em space</dd><dt>U+2004</dt><dd>Three-per-em space</dd><dt>U+2005</dt><dd>Four-per-em space</dd><dt>U+2006</dt><dd>Six-per-em space</dd><dt>U+2007</dt><dd>Figure space</dd><dt>U+2008</dt><dd>Punctuation space</dd><dt>U+2009</dt><dd>Thin space</dd><dt>U+200A</dt><dd>Hair space</dd><dt>U+202F</dt><dd>Narrow no-break space</dd><dt>U+205F</dt><dd>Medium mathematical space</dd><dt>U+3000</dt><dd>Ideographic space</dd></dl><p>The following are the vertical space characters:</p><dl><dt>U+000A</dt><dd>Line feed (LF)</dd><dt>U+000B</dt><dd>Vertical tab (VT)</dd><dt>U+000C</dt><dd>Form feed (FF)</dd><dt>U+000D</dt><dd>Carriage return (CR)</dd><dt>U+0085</dt><dd>Next line (NEL)</dd><dt>U+2028</dt><dd>Line separator</dd><dt>U+2029</dt><dd>Paragraph separator</dd></dl><p>In 8-bit, non-UTF-8 mode, only the characters with code points &lt; 256
are relevant.</p><p><em>Newline Sequences</em></p><a name="newline_sequences"></a><p>Outside a character class, by default, the escape sequence \R matches any
Unicode newline sequence. In non-UTF-8 mode, \R is equivalent to the
following:</p><pre><code class="">
(?&gt;\r\n|\n|\x0b|\f|\r|\x85)</code></pre><p>This is an example of an "atomic group", details are provided below.</p><p>This particular group matches either the two-character sequence CR
followed by LF, or one of the single characters LF (line feed, U+000A),
VT (vertical tab, U+000B), FF (form feed, U+000C), CR (carriage return,
U+000D), or NEL (next line, U+0085). The two-character sequence is
treated as a single unit that cannot be split.</p><p>In Unicode mode, two more characters whose code points are &gt; 255 are
added: LS (line separator, U+2028) and PS (paragraph separator, U+2029).
Unicode character property support is not needed for these characters to
be recognized.</p><p>\R can be restricted to match only CR, LF, or CRLF (instead of the
complete set of Unicode line endings) by setting option <strong>bsr_anycrlf</strong>
either at compile time or when the pattern is matched. (BSR is an acronym
for "backslash R".) This can be made the default when PCRE is built; if
so, the other behavior can be requested through option
<strong>bsr_unicode</strong>. These settings can also be specified by starting a
pattern string with one of the following sequences:</p><dl><dt>(*BSR_ANYCRLF)</dt><dd>CR, LF, or CRLF only</dd><dt>(*BSR_UNICODE)</dt><dd>Any Unicode newline sequence</dd></dl><p>These override the default and the options specified to the compiling
function, but they can themselves be overridden by options specified to a
matching function. Notice that these special settings, which are not
Perl-compatible, are recognized only at the very start of a pattern, and
that they must be in upper case. If more than one of them is present, the
last one is used. They can be combined with a change of newline
convention; for example, a pattern can start with:</p><pre><code class="">
(*ANY)(*BSR_ANYCRLF)</code></pre><p>They can also be combined with the (*UTF8), (*UTF), or (*UCP) special
sequences. Inside a character class, \R is treated as an unrecognized
escape sequence, and so matches the letter "R" by default.</p><p><em>Unicode Character Properties</em></p><p>Three more escape sequences that match characters with specific
properties are available. When in 8-bit non-UTF-8 mode, these sequences
are limited to testing characters whose code points are &lt;
256, but they do work in this mode. The following are the extra escape
sequences:</p><dl><dt>\p{<em>xx</em>}</dt><dd>A character with property <em>xx</em></dd><dt>\P{<em>xx</em>}</dt><dd>A character without property <em>xx</em></dd><dt>\X</dt><dd>A Unicode extended grapheme cluster</dd></dl><p>The property names represented by <em>xx</em> above are limited to the
Unicode script names, the general category properties, "Any", which
matches any character (including newline), and some special PCRE
properties (described in the next section). Other Perl properties, such as
"InMusicalSymbols", are currently not supported by PCRE. Notice that
\P{Any} does not match any characters and always causes a match
failure.</p><p>Sets of Unicode characters are defined as belonging to certain scripts.
A character from one of these sets can be matched using a script name, for
example:</p><pre><code class="">
\p{Greek} \P{Han}</code></pre><p>Those that are not part of an identified script are lumped together as
"Common". The following is the current list of scripts:</p><ul><li>Arabic</li><li>Armenian</li><li>Avestan</li><li>Balinese</li><li>Bamum</li><li>Bassa_Vah</li><li>Batak</li><li>Bengali</li><li>Bopomofo</li><li>Braille</li><li>Buginese</li><li>Buhid</li><li>Canadian_Aboriginal</li><li>Carian</li><li>Caucasian_Albanian</li><li>Chakma</li><li>Cham</li><li>Cherokee</li><li>Common</li><li>Coptic</li><li>Cuneiform</li><li>Cypriot</li><li>Cyrillic</li><li>Deseret</li><li>Devanagari</li><li>Duployan</li><li>Egyptian_Hieroglyphs</li><li>Elbasan</li><li>Ethiopic</li><li>Georgian</li><li>Glagolitic</li><li>Gothic</li><li>Grantha</li><li>Greek</li><li>Gujarati</li><li>Gurmukhi</li><li>Han</li><li>Hangul</li><li>Hanunoo</li><li>Hebrew</li><li>Hiragana</li><li>Imperial_Aramaic</li><li>Inherited</li><li>Inscriptional_Pahlavi</li><li>Inscriptional_Parthian</li><li>Javanese</li><li>Kaithi</li><li>Kannada</li><li>Katakana</li><li>Kayah_Li</li><li>Kharoshthi</li><li>Khmer</li><li>Khojki</li><li>Khudawadi</li><li>Lao</li><li>Latin</li><li>Lepcha</li><li>Limbu</li><li>Linear_A</li><li>Linear_B</li><li>Lisu</li><li>Lycian</li><li>Lydian</li><li>Mahajani</li><li>Malayalam</li><li>Mandaic</li><li>Manichaean</li><li>Meetei_Mayek</li><li>Mende_Kikakui</li><li>Meroitic_Cursive</li><li>Meroitic_Hieroglyphs</li><li>Miao</li><li>Modi</li><li>Mongolian</li><li>Mro</li><li>Myanmar</li><li>Nabataean</li><li>New_Tai_Lue</li><li>Nko</li><li>Ogham</li><li>Ol_Chiki</li><li>Old_Italic</li><li>Old_North_Arabian</li><li>Old_Permic</li><li>Old_Persian</li><li>Oriya</li><li>Old_South_Arabian</li><li>Old_Turkic</li><li>Osmanya</li><li>Pahawh_Hmong</li><li>Palmyrene</li><li>Pau_Cin_Hau</li><li>Phags_Pa</li><li>Phoenician</li><li>Psalter_Pahlavi</li><li>Rejang</li><li>Runic</li><li>Samaritan</li><li>Saurashtra</li><li>Sharada</li><li>Shavian</li><li>Siddham</li><li>Sinhala</li><li>Sora_Sompeng</li><li>Sundanese</li><li>Syloti_Nagri</li><li>Syriac</li><li>Tagalog</li><li>Tagbanwa</li><li>Tai_Le</li><li>Tai_Tham</li><li>Tai_Viet</li><li>Takri</li><li>Tamil</li><li>Telugu</li><li>Thaana</li><li>Thai</li><li>Tibetan</li><li>Tifinagh</li><li>Tirhuta</li><li>Ugaritic</li><li>Vai</li><li>Warang_Citi</li><li>Yi</li></ul><p>Each character has exactly one Unicode general category property,
specified by a two-letter acronym. For compatibility with Perl, negation
can be specified by including a circumflex between the opening brace and
the property name. For example, \p{^Lu} is the same as \P{Lu}.</p><p>If only one letter is specified with \p or \P, it includes all the
general category properties that start with that letter. In this case, in
the absence of negation, the curly brackets in the escape sequence are
optional. The following two examples have the same effect:</p><pre><code class="">
\p{L}
\pL</code></pre><p>The following general category property codes are supported:</p><dl><dt>C</dt><dd>Other</dd><dt>Cc</dt><dd>Control</dd><dt>Cf</dt><dd>Format</dd><dt>Cn</dt><dd>Unassigned</dd><dt>Co</dt><dd>Private use</dd><dt>Cs</dt><dd>Surrogate</dd><dt>L</dt><dd>Letter</dd><dt>Ll</dt><dd>Lowercase letter</dd><dt>Lm</dt><dd>Modifier letter</dd><dt>Lo</dt><dd>Other letter</dd><dt>Lt</dt><dd>Title case letter</dd><dt>Lu</dt><dd>Uppercase letter</dd><dt>M</dt><dd>Mark</dd><dt>Mc</dt><dd>Spacing mark</dd><dt>Me</dt><dd>Enclosing mark</dd><dt>Mn</dt><dd>Non-spacing mark</dd><dt>N</dt><dd>Number</dd><dt>Nd</dt><dd>Decimal number</dd><dt>Nl</dt><dd>Letter number</dd><dt>No</dt><dd>Other number</dd><dt>P</dt><dd>Punctuation</dd><dt>Pc</dt><dd>Connector punctuation</dd><dt>Pd</dt><dd>Dash punctuation</dd><dt>Pe</dt><dd>Close punctuation</dd><dt>Pf</dt><dd>Final punctuation</dd><dt>Pi</dt><dd>Initial punctuation</dd><dt>Po</dt><dd>Other punctuation</dd><dt>Ps</dt><dd>Open punctuation</dd><dt>S</dt><dd>Symbol</dd><dt>Sc</dt><dd>Currency symbol</dd><dt>Sk</dt><dd>Modifier symbol</dd><dt>Sm</dt><dd>Mathematical symbol</dd><dt>So</dt><dd>Other symbol</dd><dt>Z</dt><dd>Separator</dd><dt>Zl</dt><dd>Line separator</dd><dt>Zp</dt><dd>Paragraph separator</dd><dt>Zs</dt><dd>Space separator</dd></dl><p>The special property L&amp; is also supported. It matches a character
that has the Lu, Ll, or Lt property, that is, a letter that is not
classified as a modifier or "other".</p><p>The Cs (Surrogate) property applies only to characters in the range
U+D800 to U+DFFF. Such characters are invalid in Unicode strings and so
cannot be tested by PCRE. Perl does not support the Cs property.</p><p>The long synonyms for property names supported by Perl (such as
\p{Letter}) are not supported by PCRE. It is not permitted to prefix any
of these properties with "Is".</p><p>No character in the Unicode table has the Cn (unassigned) property.
This property is instead assumed for any code point that is not in the
Unicode table.</p><p>Specifying caseless matching does not affect these escape sequences. For
example, \p{Lu} always matches only uppercase letters. This is different
from the behavior of current versions of Perl.</p><p>Matching characters by Unicode property is not fast, as PCRE must do a
multistage table lookup to find a character property. That is why the
traditional escape sequences such as \d and \w do not use Unicode
properties in PCRE by default. However, you can make them do so by setting
option <strong>ucp</strong> or by starting the pattern with (*UCP).</p><p><em>Extended Grapheme Clusters</em></p><p>The \X escape matches any number of Unicode characters that form an
"extended grapheme cluster", and treats the sequence as an atomic group
(see below). Up to and including release 8.31, PCRE matched an earlier,
simpler definition that was equivalent to <strong>(?&gt;\PM\pM*)</strong>. That is,
it matched a character without the "mark" property, followed by zero or
more characters with the "mark" property. Characters with the "mark"
property are typically non-spacing accents that affect the preceding
character.</p><p>This simple definition was extended in Unicode to include more
complicated kinds of composite character by giving each character a
grapheme breaking property, and creating rules that use these properties
to define the boundaries of extended grapheme clusters. In PCRE releases
later than 8.31, \X matches one of these clusters.</p><p>\X always matches at least one character. Then it decides whether to add
more characters according to the following rules for ending a cluster:</p><ul><li> <p>End at the end of the subject string.</p> </li><li> <p>Do not end between CR and LF; otherwise end after any control
character.</p> </li><li> <p>Do not break Hangul (a Korean script) syllable sequences. Hangul
characters are of five types: L, V, T, LV, and LVT. An L character can
be followed by an L, V, LV, or LVT character. An LV or V character can
be followed by a V or T character. An LVT or T character can be
followed only by a T character.</p> </li><li> <p>Do not end before extending characters or spacing marks. Characters
with the "mark" property always have the "extend" grapheme breaking
property.</p> </li><li> <p>Do not end after prepend characters.</p> </li><li> <p>Otherwise, end the cluster.</p> </li></ul><p><em>PCRE Additional Properties</em></p><p>In addition to the standard Unicode properties described earlier, PCRE
supports four more that make it possible to convert traditional escape
sequences, such as \w and \s to use Unicode
properties. PCRE uses these non-standard, non-Perl properties internally
when the <strong>ucp</strong> option is passed. However, they can also be used
explicitly. The properties are as follows:</p><dl><dt>Xan</dt><dd> <p>Any alphanumeric character. Matches characters that have either the
L (letter) or the N (number) property.</p> </dd><dt>Xps</dt><dd> <p>Any Posix space character. Matches the characters tab, line feed,
vertical tab, form feed, carriage return, and any other character
that has the Z (separator) property.</p> </dd><dt>Xsp</dt><dd> <p>Any Perl space character. Matches the same as Xps, except that
vertical tab is excluded.</p> </dd><dt>Xwd</dt><dd> <p>Any Perl "word" character. Matches the same characters as Xan, plus
underscore.</p> </dd></dl><p>Perl and POSIX space are now the same. Perl added VT to its space
character set at release 5.18 and PCRE changed at release 8.34.</p><p>Xan matches characters that have either the L (letter) or the N (number)
property. Xps matches the characters tab, linefeed, vertical tab, form feed,
or carriage return, and any other character that has the Z (separator)
property. Xsp is the same as Xps; it used to exclude vertical tab, for Perl
compatibility, but Perl changed, and so PCRE followed at release 8.34. Xwd
matches the same characters as Xan, plus underscore.
</p><p>There is another non-standard property, Xuc, which matches any character
that can be represented by a Universal Character Name in C++ and other
programming languages. These are the characters $, @, ` (grave accent),
and all characters with Unicode code points &gt;= U+00A0, except for the
surrogates U+D800 to U+DFFF. Notice that most base (ASCII) characters are
excluded. (Universal Character Names are of the form \uHHHH or \UHHHHHHHH,
where H is a hexadecimal digit. Notice that the Xuc property does not
match these sequences but the characters that they represent.)</p><p><em>Resetting the Match Start</em></p><p>The escape sequence \K causes any previously matched characters not to
be included in the final matched sequence. For example, the following
pattern matches "foobar", but reports that it has matched "bar":</p><pre><code class="">
foo\Kbar</code></pre><p>This feature is similar to a lookbehind assertion
(described below). However, in this case, the part of the subject before
the real match does not have to be of fixed length, as lookbehind
assertions do. The use of \K does not interfere with the setting of
captured substrings. For example, when the following pattern matches
"foobar", the first substring is still set to "foo":</p><pre><code class="">
(foo)\Kbar</code></pre><p>Perl documents that the use of \K within assertions is "not well
defined". In PCRE, \K is acted upon when it occurs inside positive
assertions, but is ignored in negative assertions. Note that when a
pattern such as (?=ab\K) matches, the reported start of the match can
be greater than the end of the match.</p><p><em>Simple Assertions</em></p><p>The final use of backslash is for certain simple assertions. An
assertion specifies a condition that must be met at a particular point in
a match, without consuming any characters from the subject string. The
use of subpatterns for more complicated assertions is described below. The
following are the backslashed assertions:</p><dl><dt>\b</dt><dd>Matches at a word boundary.</dd><dt>\B</dt><dd>Matches when not at a word boundary.</dd><dt>\A</dt><dd>Matches at the start of the subject.</dd><dt>\Z</dt><dd>Matches at the end of the subject, and before a newline at the end of the subject.</dd><dt>\z</dt><dd>Matches only at the end of the subject.</dd><dt>\G</dt><dd>Matches at the first matching position in the subject. </dd></dl><p>Inside a character class, \b has a different meaning; it matches the
backspace character. If any other of these assertions appears in a
character class, by default it matches the corresponding literal character
(for example, \B matches the letter B).</p><p>A word boundary is a position in the subject string where the current
character and the previous character do not both match \w or \W (that is,
one matches \w and the other matches \W), or the start or end of the
string if the first or last character matches \w, respectively. In UTF
mode, the meanings of \w and \W can be changed by setting option
<strong>ucp</strong>. When this is done, it also affects \b and \B. PCRE and Perl do
not have a separate "start of word" or "end of word" metasequence.
However, whatever follows \b normally determines which it is. For example,
the fragment \ba matches "a" at the start of a word.</p><p>The \A, \Z, and \z assertions differ from the traditional circumflex and
dollar (described in the next section) in that they only ever match at the
very start and end of the subject string, whatever options are set. Thus,
they are independent of multiline mode. These three assertions are not
affected by options <strong>notbol</strong> or <strong>noteol</strong>, which affect only the
behavior of the circumflex and dollar metacharacters. However, if argument
<strong>startoffset</strong> of <a href="#run/3">run/3</a> is
non-zero, indicating that matching is to start at a point other than the
beginning of the subject, \A can never match. The difference between \Z
and \z is that \Z matches before a newline at the end of the string and
at the very end, while \z matches only at the end.</p><p>The \G assertion is true only when the current matching position is at
the start point of the match, as specified by argument <strong>startoffset</strong>
of <strong>run/3</strong>. It differs from \A when the value of <strong>startoffset</strong>
is non-zero. By calling <strong>run/3</strong> multiple times with appropriate
arguments, you can mimic the Perl option <strong>/g</strong>, and it is in this
kind of implementation where \G can be useful.</p><p>Notice, however, that the PCRE interpretation of \G, as the start of the
current match, is subtly different from Perl, which defines it as the end
of the previous match. In Perl, these can be different when the previously
matched string was empty. As PCRE does only one match at a time, it cannot
reproduce this behavior.</p><p>If all the alternatives of a pattern begin with \G, the expression is
anchored to the starting match position, and the "anchored" flag is set in
the compiled regular expression.</p><a name="sect4"></a><h3>Circumflex and Dollar</h3><p>The circumflex and dollar metacharacters are zero-width assertions. That
is, they test for a particular condition to be true without consuming any
characters from the subject string.</p><p>Outside a character class, in the default matching mode, the circumflex
character is an assertion that is true only if the current matching point
is at the start of the subject string. If argument <strong>startoffset</strong> of
<a href="#run/3">run/3</a> is non-zero, circumflex
can never match if option <strong>multiline</strong> is unset. Inside a character
class, circumflex has an entirely different meaning (see below).</p><p>Circumflex needs not to be the first character of the pattern if
some alternatives are involved, but it is to be the first thing in
each alternative in which it appears if the pattern is ever to match that
branch. If all possible alternatives start with a circumflex, that is, if
the pattern is constrained to match only at the start of the subject, it
is said to be an "anchored" pattern. (There are also other constructs that
can cause a pattern to be anchored.)</p><p>The dollar character is an assertion that is true only if the current
matching point is at the end of the subject string, or immediately before
a newline at the end of the string (by default). Notice however that it
does not match the newline. Dollar needs not to be the last character of
the pattern if some alternatives are involved, but it is to be the
last item in any branch in which it appears. Dollar has no special meaning
in a character class.</p><p>The meaning of dollar can be changed so that it matches only at the very
end of the string, by setting option <strong>dollar_endonly</strong> at compile
time. This does not affect the \Z assertion.</p><p>The meanings of the circumflex and dollar characters are changed if
option <strong>multiline</strong> is set. When this is the case, a circumflex
matches immediately after internal newlines and at the start of the
subject string. It does not match after a newline that ends the string. A
dollar matches before any newlines in the string, and at the very end,
when <strong>multiline</strong> is set. When newline is specified as the
two-character sequence CRLF, isolated CR and LF characters do not
indicate newlines.</p><p>For example, the pattern /^abc$/ matches the subject string "def\nabc"
(where \n represents a newline) in multiline mode, but not otherwise.
So, patterns that are anchored in single-line mode because all
branches start with ^ are not anchored in multiline mode, and a match for
circumflex is possible when argument <em>startoffset</em> of <strong>run/3</strong>
is non-zero. Option <strong>dollar_endonly</strong> is ignored if <strong>multiline</strong>
is set.</p><p>Notice that the sequences \A, \Z, and \z can be used to match the start
and end of the subject in both modes. If all branches of a pattern start
with \A, it is always anchored, regardless if <strong>multiline</strong> is set.</p><a name="sect5"></a><h3>Full Stop (Period, Dot) and \N</h3><p>Outside a character class, a dot in the pattern matches any character in
the subject string except (by default) a character that signifies the end
of a line.</p><p>When a line ending is defined as a single character, dot never matches
that character. When the two-character sequence CRLF is used, dot does not
match CR if it is immediately followed by LF, otherwise it matches all
characters (including isolated CRs and LFs). When any Unicode line endings
are recognized, dot does not match CR, LF, or any of the other
line-ending characters.</p><p>The behavior of dot regarding newlines can be changed.  If option
<strong>dotall</strong> is set, a dot matches any character, without exception. If
the two-character sequence CRLF is present in the subject string, it takes
two dots to match it.</p><p>The handling of dot is entirely independent of the handling of circumflex
and dollar, the only relationship is that both involve newlines. Dot has
no special meaning in a character class.</p><p>The escape sequence \N behaves like a dot, except that it is not affected
by option <strong>PCRE_DOTALL</strong>. That is, it matches any character except one
that signifies the end of a line. Perl also uses \N to match characters by
name but PCRE does not support this.</p><a name="sect6"></a><h3>Matching a Single Data Unit</h3><p>Outside a character class, the escape sequence \C matches any data unit,
regardless if a UTF mode is set. One data unit is one byte. Unlike a dot,
\C always matches line-ending characters. The feature is provided in Perl
to match individual bytes in UTF-8 mode, but it is unclear how it can
usefully be used. As \C breaks up characters into individual data units,
matching one unit with \C in a UTF mode means that the remaining string
can start with a malformed UTF character. This has undefined results, as
PCRE assumes that it deals with valid UTF strings.</p><p>PCRE does not allow \C to appear in lookbehind assertions (described
below) in a UTF mode, as this would make it impossible to calculate the
length of the lookbehind.</p><p>The \C escape sequence is best avoided. However, one way of using it that
avoids the problem of malformed UTF characters is to use a lookahead to
check the length of the next character, as in the following pattern, which
can be used with a UTF-8 string (ignore whitespace and line breaks):</p><pre><code class="">
(?| (?=[\x00-\x7f])(\C) |
    (?=[\x80-\x{7ff}])(\C)(\C) |
    (?=[\x{800}-\x{ffff}])(\C)(\C)(\C) |
    (?=[\x{10000}-\x{1fffff}])(\C)(\C)(\C)(\C))</code></pre><p>A group that starts with (?| resets the capturing parentheses numbers in
each alternative (see section <a href="#sect12">Duplicate Subpattern Numbers</a>). The assertions at the start of each branch
check the next UTF-8 character for values whose encoding uses 1, 2, 3, or
4 bytes, respectively. The individual bytes of the character are then
captured by the appropriate number of groups.</p><a name="sect7"></a><h3>Square Brackets and Character Classes</h3><p>An opening square bracket introduces a character class, terminated by a
closing square bracket. A closing square bracket on its own is not special
by default. However, if option <strong>PCRE_JAVASCRIPT_COMPAT</strong> is set, a
lone closing square bracket causes a compile-time error. If a closing
square bracket is required as a member of the class, it is to be the first
data character in the class (after an initial circumflex, if present) or
escaped with a backslash.</p><p>A character class matches a single character in the subject. In a UTF
mode, the character can be more than one data unit long. A matched
character must be in the set of characters defined by the class, unless
the first character in the class definition is a circumflex, in which case
the subject character must not be in the set defined by the class. If a
circumflex is required as a member of the class, ensure that it is not the
first character, or escape it with a backslash.</p><p>For example, the character class <strong>[aeiou]</strong> matches any lowercase
vowel, while <strong>[^aeiou]</strong> matches any character that is not a lowercase
vowel. Notice that a circumflex is just a convenient notation for
specifying the characters that are in the class by enumerating those that
are not. A class that starts with a circumflex is not an assertion; it
still consumes a character from the subject string, and therefore it fails
if the current pointer is at the end of the string.</p><p>In UTF-8 mode, characters with values &gt; 255 (0xffff) can be included
in a class as a literal string of data units, or by using the \x{ escaping
mechanism.</p><p>When caseless matching is set, any letters in a class represent both
their uppercase and lowercase versions. For example, a caseless
<strong>[aeiou]</strong> matches "A" and "a", and a caseless <strong>[^aeiou]</strong> does
not match "A", but a caseful version would. In a UTF mode, PCRE always
understands the concept of case for characters whose values are &lt; 256,
so caseless matching is always possible. For characters with higher
values, the concept of case is supported only if PCRE is compiled with
Unicode property support. If you want to use caseless matching in a UTF
mode for characters &gt;=, ensure that PCRE is compiled with Unicode
property support and with UTF support.</p><p>Characters that can indicate line breaks are never treated in any special
way when matching character classes, whatever line-ending sequence is in
use, and whatever setting of options <strong>PCRE_DOTALL</strong> and
<strong>PCRE_MULTILINE</strong> is used. A class such as [^a] always matches one of
these characters.</p><p>The minus (hyphen) character can be used to specify a range of characters
in a character class. For example, [d-m] matches any letter between d and
m, inclusive. If a minus character is required in a class, it must be
escaped with a backslash or appear in a position where it cannot be
interpreted as indicating a range, typically as the first or last
character in the class, or immediately after a range. For example, [b-d-z]
matches letters in the range b to d, a hyphen character, or z.</p><p>The literal character "]" cannot be the end character of a range. A
pattern such as [W-]46] is interpreted as a class of two characters ("W"
and "-") followed by a literal string "46]", so it would match "W46]" or
"-46]". However, if "]" is escaped with a backslash, it is interpreted as
the end of range, so [W-\]46] is interpreted as a class containing a range
followed by two other characters. The octal or hexadecimal representation
of "]" can also be used to end a range.</p><p>An error is generated if a POSIX character class (see below) or an
escape sequence other than one that defines a single character appears at
a point where a range ending character is expected. For example, [z-\xff]
is valid, but [A-\d] and [A-[:digit:]] are not.</p><p>Ranges operate in the collating sequence of character values. They can
also be used for characters specified numerically, for example,
[\000-\037]. Ranges can include any characters that are valid for the
current mode.</p><p>If a range that includes letters is used when caseless matching is set,
it matches the letters in either case. For example, [W-c] is equivalent to
[][\\^_`wxyzabc], matched caselessly. In a non-UTF mode, if character
tables for a French locale are in use, [\xc8-\xcb] matches accented E
characters in both cases. In UTF modes, PCRE supports the concept of case
for characters with values &gt; 255 only when it is compiled with Unicode
property support.</p><p>The character escape sequences \d, \D, \h, \H, \p, \P, \s, \S, \v, \V,
\w, and \W can appear in a character class, and add the characters that
they match to the class. For example, [\dABCDEF] matches any hexadecimal
digit. In UTF modes, option <strong>ucp</strong> affects the meanings of \d, \s, \w
and their uppercase partners, just as it does when they appear outside a
character class, as described in section
<a href="#generic_character_types">Generic Character Types</a> earlier. The escape sequence \b has a different meaning
inside a character class; it matches the backspace character. The
sequences \B, \N, \R, and \X are not special inside a character class.
Like any other unrecognized escape sequences, they are treated as the
literal characters "B", "N", "R", and "X".</p><p>A circumflex can conveniently be used with the uppercase character types
to specify a more restricted set of characters than the matching lowercase
type. For example, class [^\W_] matches any letter or digit, but not
underscore, while [\w] includes underscore. A positive character class
is to be read as "something OR something OR ..." and a negative class as
"NOT something AND NOT something AND NOT ...".</p><p>Only the following metacharacters are recognized in character
classes:</p><ul><li>Backslash</li><li>Hyphen (only where it can be interpreted as specifying a range)</li><li>Circumflex (only at the start)</li><li>Opening square bracket (only when it can be interpreted as introducing a Posix class name, or for a special compatibility feature; see the next two sections)</li><li>Terminating closing square bracket</li></ul><p>However, escaping other non-alphanumeric characters does no harm.</p><a name="sect8"></a><h3>Posix Character Classes</h3><p>Perl supports the Posix notation for character classes. This uses names
enclosed by [: and :] within the enclosing square brackets. PCRE also
supports this notation. For example, the following matches "0", "1", any
alphabetic character, or "%":</p><pre><code class="">
[01[:alpha:]%]</code></pre><p>The following are the supported class names:</p><dl><dt>alnum</dt><dd>Letters and digits</dd><dt>alpha</dt><dd>Letters</dd><dt>ascii</dt><dd>Character codes 0-127</dd><dt>blank</dt><dd>Space or tab only</dd><dt>cntrl</dt><dd>Control characters</dd><dt>digit</dt><dd>Decimal digits (same as \d)</dd><dt>graph</dt><dd>Printing characters, excluding space</dd><dt>lower</dt><dd>Lowercase letters</dd><dt>print</dt><dd>Printing characters, including space</dd><dt>punct</dt><dd>Printing characters, excluding letters, digits, and space</dd><dt>space</dt><dd>Whitespace (the same as \s from PCRE 8.34)</dd><dt>upper</dt><dd>Uppercase letters</dd><dt>word</dt><dd>"Word" characters (same as \w)</dd><dt>xdigit</dt><dd>Hexadecimal digits</dd></dl><p>The default "space" characters are HT (9), LF (10), VT (11), FF (12),
CR (13), and space (32). If locale-specific matching is taking place, the
list of space characters may be different; there may be fewer or more of
them. "Space" used to be different to \s, which did not include VT, for
Perl compatibility. However, Perl changed at release 5.18, and PCRE followed
at release 8.34. "Space" and \s now match the same set of characters.</p><p>The name "word" is a Perl extension, and "blank" is a GNU extension from
Perl 5.8. Another Perl extension is negation, which is indicated by a ^
character after the colon. For example, the following matches "1", "2",
or any non-digit:</p><pre><code class="">
[12[:^digit:]]</code></pre><p>PCRE (and Perl) also recognize the Posix syntax [.ch.] and [=ch=] where
"ch" is a "collating element", but these are not supported, and an error
is given if they are encountered.</p><p>By default, characters with values &gt; 255 do not match
any of the Posix character classes. However, if option <strong>PCRE_UCP</strong> is
passed to <strong>pcre_compile()</strong>, some of the classes are changed so that
Unicode character properties are used. This is achieved by replacing
certain Posix classes by other sequences, as follows:</p><dl><dt>[:alnum:]</dt><dd>Becomes <em>\p{Xan}</em></dd><dt>[:alpha:]</dt><dd>Becomes <em>\p{L}</em></dd><dt>[:blank:]</dt><dd>Becomes <em>\h</em></dd><dt>[:digit:]</dt><dd>Becomes <em>\p{Nd}</em></dd><dt>[:lower:]</dt><dd>Becomes <em>\p{Ll}</em></dd><dt>[:space:]</dt><dd>Becomes <em>\p{Xps}</em></dd><dt>[:upper:]</dt><dd>Becomes <em>\p{Lu}</em></dd><dt>[:word:]</dt><dd>Becomes <em>\p{Xwd}</em></dd></dl><p>Negated versions, such as [:^alpha:], use \P instead of \p. Three other
POSIX classes are handled specially in UCP mode:</p><dl><dt>[:graph:]</dt><dd><p>This matches characters that have glyphs that mark the page
when printed. In Unicode property terms, it matches all characters with
the L, M, N, P, S, or Cf properties, except for:</p> <dl><dt>U+061C</dt><dd><p>Arabic Letter Mark</p></dd><dt>U+180E</dt><dd><p>Mongolian Vowel Separator</p></dd><dt>U+2066 - U+2069</dt><dd><p>Various "isolate"s</p></dd></dl> </dd><dt>[:print:]</dt><dd><p>This matches the same characters as [:graph:] plus space
characters that are not controls, that is, characters with the Zs
property.</p></dd><dt>[:punct:]</dt><dd><p>This matches all characters that have
the Unicode P (punctuation) property, plus those characters whose code
points are less than 128 that have the S (Symbol) property.</p></dd></dl><p>The other POSIX classes are unchanged, and match only characters with
code points less than 128.
</p><p><em>Compatibility Feature for Word Boundaries</em></p><p>In the POSIX.2 compliant library that was included in 4.4BSD Unix,
the ugly syntax [[:&lt;:]] and [[:&gt;:]] is used for matching "start
of word" and "end of word". PCRE treats these items as follows:</p><dl><dt>[[:&lt;:]]</dt><dd><p>is converted to  \b(?=\w)</p></dd><dt>[[:&gt;:]]</dt><dd><p>is converted to  \b(?&lt;=\w)</p></dd></dl><p>Only these exact character sequences are recognized. A sequence such as
[a[:&lt;:]b] provokes error for an unrecognized POSIX class name. This
support is not compatible with Perl. It is provided to help migrations from
other environments, and is best not used in any new patterns. Note that \b
matches at the start and the end of a word (see "Simple assertions" above),
and in a Perl-style pattern the preceding or following character normally
shows which is wanted, without the need for the assertions that are used
above in order to give exactly the POSIX behaviour.</p><a name="sect9"></a><h3>Vertical Bar</h3><p>Vertical bar characters are used to separate alternative patterns. For
example, the following pattern matches either "gilbert" or "sullivan":</p><pre><code class="">
gilbert|sullivan</code></pre><p>Any number of alternatives can appear, and an empty alternative is
permitted (matching the empty string). The matching process tries each
alternative in turn, from left to right, and the first that succeeds is
used. If the alternatives are within a subpattern (defined in section
<a href="#sect11">Subpatterns</a>), "succeeds" means
matching the remaining main pattern and the alternative in the
subpattern.</p><a name="sect10"></a><h3>Internal Option Setting</h3><p>The settings of the Perl-compatible options <strong>caseless</strong>,
<strong>multiline</strong>, <strong>dotall</strong>, and <strong>extended</strong> can be changed from
within the pattern by a sequence of Perl option letters enclosed between
"(?" and ")". The option letters are as follows:</p><dl><dt>i</dt><dd>For <strong>caseless</strong></dd><dt>m</dt><dd>For <strong>multiline</strong></dd><dt>s</dt><dd>For <strong>dotall</strong></dd><dt>x</dt><dd>For <strong>extended</strong></dd></dl><p>For example, <strong>(?im)</strong> sets caseless, multiline matching. These
options can also be unset by preceding the letter with a hyphen. A
combined setting and unsetting such as <strong>(?im-sx)</strong>, which sets
<strong>caseless</strong> and <strong>multiline</strong>, while unsetting <strong>dotall</strong> and
<strong>extended</strong>, is also permitted. If a letter appears both before and
after the hyphen, the option is unset.</p><p>The PCRE-specific options <strong>dupnames</strong>, <strong>ungreedy</strong>, and
<strong>extra</strong> can be changed in the same way as the Perl-compatible
options by using the characters J, U, and X respectively.</p><p>When one of these option changes occurs at top-level (that is, not inside
subpattern parentheses), the change applies to the remainder of the
pattern that follows.</p><p>An option change within a subpattern (see section
<a href="#sect11">Subpatterns</a>) affects only that part of
the subpattern that follows it. So, the following matches abc and aBc and
no other strings (assuming <strong>caseless</strong> is not used):</p><pre><code class="">
(a(?i)b)c</code></pre><p>By this means, options can be made to have different settings in
different parts of the pattern. Any changes made in one alternative do
carry on into subsequent branches within the same subpattern. For
example:</p><pre><code class="">
(a(?i)b|c)</code></pre><p>matches "ab", "aB", "c", and "C", although when matching "C" the first
branch is abandoned before the option setting. This is because the effects
of option settings occur at compile time. There would be some weird
behavior otherwise.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>Other PCRE-specific options can be set by the application when the
compiling or matching functions are called. Sometimes the pattern can
contain special leading sequences, such as (*CRLF), to override what
the application has set or what has been defaulted. Details are provided
in section <a href="#newline_sequences"> Newline Sequences</a> earlier.</p><p>The (*UTF8) and (*UCP) leading sequences can be used to set UTF and
Unicode property modes. They are equivalent to setting options
<strong>unicode</strong> and <strong>ucp</strong>, respectively. The (*UTF) sequence is a
generic version that can be used with any of the libraries. However,
the application can set option <strong>never_utf</strong>, which locks out the
use of the (*UTF) sequences.</p></div><a name="sect11"></a><h3>Subpatterns</h3><p>Subpatterns are delimited by parentheses (round brackets), which can be
nested. Turning part of a pattern into a subpattern does two things:</p><dl><dt>1.</dt><dd> <p>It localizes a set of alternatives. For example, the following
pattern matches "cataract", "caterpillar", or "cat":</p> <pre><code class="">
cat(aract|erpillar|)</code></pre> <p>Without the parentheses, it would match "cataract", "erpillar", or an
empty string.</p> </dd><dt>2.</dt><dd> <p>It sets up the subpattern as a capturing subpattern. That is, when
the complete pattern matches, that portion of the subject string that
matched the subpattern is passed back to the caller through the
return value of <a href="#run/3">run/3</a>.</p> </dd></dl><p>Opening parentheses are counted from left to right (starting from 1) to
obtain numbers for the capturing subpatterns. For example, if the string
"the red king" is matched against the following pattern, the captured
substrings are "red king", "red", and "king", and are numbered 1, 2, and
3, respectively:</p><pre><code class="">
the ((red|white) (king|queen))</code></pre><p>It is not always helpful that plain parentheses fulfill two functions.
Often a grouping subpattern is required without a capturing requirement.
If an opening parenthesis is followed by a question mark and a colon, the
subpattern does not do any capturing, and is not counted when computing
the number of any subsequent capturing subpatterns. For example, if the
string "the white queen" is matched against the following pattern, the
captured substrings are "white queen" and "queen", and are numbered 1 and
2:</p><pre><code class="">
the ((?:red|white) (king|queen))</code></pre><p>The maximum number of capturing subpatterns is 65535.</p><p>As a convenient shorthand, if any option settings are required at the
start of a non-capturing subpattern, the option letters can appear between
"?" and ":". Thus, the following two patterns match the same set of
strings:</p><pre><code class="">
(?i:saturday|sunday)
(?:(?i)saturday|sunday)</code></pre><p>As alternative branches are tried from left to right, and options are not
reset until the end of the subpattern is reached, an option setting in one
branch does affect subsequent branches, so the above patterns match both
"SUNDAY" and "Saturday".</p><a name="sect12"></a><h3>Duplicate Subpattern Numbers</h3><p>Perl 5.10 introduced a feature where each alternative in a subpattern
uses the same numbers for its capturing parentheses. Such a subpattern
starts with <strong>(?|</strong> and is itself a non-capturing subpattern. For
example, consider the following pattern:</p><pre><code class="">
(?|(Sat)ur|(Sun))day</code></pre><p>As the two alternatives are inside a <strong>(?|</strong> group, both sets of
capturing parentheses are numbered one. Thus, when the pattern matches,
you can look at captured substring number one, whichever alternative
matched. This construct is useful when you want to capture a part, but
not all, of one of many alternatives. Inside a <strong>(?|</strong> group,
parentheses are numbered as usual, but the number is reset at the start
of each branch. The numbers of any capturing parentheses that follow the
subpattern start after the highest number used in any branch.
The following example is from the Perl documentation; the numbers
underneath show in which buffer the captured content is stored:</p><pre><code class="">
# before  ---------------branch-reset----------- after
/ ( a )  (?| x ( y ) z | (p (q) r) | (t) u (v) ) ( z ) /x
# 1            2         2  3        2     3     4</code></pre><p>A back reference to a numbered subpattern uses the most recent value that
is set for that number by any subpattern. The following pattern matches
"abcabc" or "defdef":</p><pre><code class="">
/(?|(abc)|(def))\1/</code></pre><p>In contrast, a subroutine call to a numbered subpattern always refers to
the first one in the pattern with the given number. The following pattern
matches "abcabc" or "defabc":</p><pre><code class="">
/(?|(abc)|(def))(?1)/</code></pre><p>If a condition test for a subpattern having matched refers to a
non-unique number, the test is true if any of the subpatterns of that
number have matched.</p><p>An alternative approach using this "branch reset" feature is to use
duplicate named subpatterns, as described in the next section.</p><a name="sect13"></a><h3>Named Subpatterns</h3><p>Identifying capturing parentheses by number is simple, but it can be
hard to keep track of the numbers in complicated regular expressions.
Also, if an expression is modified, the numbers can change. To help with
this difficulty, PCRE supports the naming of subpatterns. This feature was
not added to Perl until release 5.10. Python had the feature earlier, and
PCRE introduced it at release 4.0, using the Python syntax. PCRE now
supports both the Perl and the Python syntax. Perl allows identically
numbered subpatterns to have different names, but PCRE does not.</p><p>In PCRE, a subpattern can be named in one of three ways:
<strong>(?&lt;name&gt;...)</strong> or <strong>(?'name'...)</strong> as in Perl, or
<strong>(?P&lt;name&gt;...)</strong> as in Python. References to capturing
parentheses from other parts of the pattern, such as back references,
recursion, and conditions, can be made by name and by number.</p><p>Names consist of up to 32 alphanumeric characters and underscores, but
must start with a non-digit. Named capturing parentheses are still allocated
numbers as well as names, exactly as if the names were not present.
The <strong>capture</strong> specification to <a href="#run/3">run/3</a> can use named values if they are present in the
regular expression.</p><p>By default, a name must be unique within a pattern, but this constraint
can be relaxed by setting option <strong>dupnames</strong> at compile time.
(Duplicate names are also always permitted for subpatterns with the same
number, set up as described in the previous section.) Duplicate names can
be useful for patterns where only one instance of the named parentheses
can match. Suppose that you want to match the name of a weekday, either as
a 3-letter abbreviation or as the full name, and in both cases you want to
extract the abbreviation. The following pattern (ignoring the line
breaks) does the job:</p><pre><code class="">
(?&lt;DN&gt;Mon|Fri|Sun)(?:day)?|
(?&lt;DN&gt;Tue)(?:sday)?|
(?&lt;DN&gt;Wed)(?:nesday)?|
(?&lt;DN&gt;Thu)(?:rsday)?|
(?&lt;DN&gt;Sat)(?:urday)?</code></pre><p>There are five capturing substrings, but only one is ever set after a
match. (An alternative way of solving this problem is to use a "branch
reset" subpattern, as described in the previous section.)</p><p>For capturing named subpatterns which names are not unique, the first
matching occurrence (counted from left to right in the subject) is
returned from <a href="#run/3">run/3</a>, if the name
is specified in the <strong>values</strong> part of the <strong>capture</strong> statement.
The <strong>all_names</strong> capturing value matches all the names in the same
way.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>You cannot use different names to distinguish between two subpatterns
with the same number, as PCRE uses only the numbers when matching. For
this reason, an error is given at compile time if different names are
specified to subpatterns with the same number. However, you can specify
the same name to subpatterns with the same number, even when
<strong>dupnames</strong> is not set.</p></div><a name="sect14"></a><h3>Repetition</h3><p>Repetition is specified by quantifiers, which can follow any of the
following items:</p><ul><li>A literal data character</li><li>The dot metacharacter</li><li>The \C escape sequence</li><li>The \X escape sequence</li><li>The \R escape sequence</li><li>An escape such as \d or \pL that matches a single character</li><li>A character class</li><li>A back reference (see the next section)</li><li>A parenthesized subpattern (including assertions)</li><li>A subroutine call to a subpattern (recursive or otherwise)</li></ul><p>The general repetition quantifier specifies a minimum and maximum number
of permitted matches, by giving the two numbers in curly brackets
(braces), separated by a comma. The numbers must be &lt; 65536, and the
first must be less than or equal to the second. For example, the following
matches "zz", "zzz", or "zzzz":</p><pre><code class="">
z{2,4}</code></pre><p>A closing brace on its own is not a special character. If the second
number is omitted, but the comma is present, there is no upper limit. If
the second number and the comma are both omitted, the quantifier specifies
an exact number of required matches. Thus, the following matches at least
three successive vowels, but can match many more:</p><pre><code class="">
[aeiou]{3,}</code></pre><p>The following matches exactly eight digits:</p><pre><code class="">
\d{8}</code></pre><p>An opening curly bracket that appears in a position where a quantifier is
not allowed, or one that does not match the syntax of a quantifier, is
taken as a literal character. For example, {,6} is not a quantifier, but a
literal string of four characters.</p><p>In Unicode mode, quantifiers apply to characters rather than to
individual data units. Thus, for example, \x{100}{2} matches two
characters, each of which is represented by a 2-byte sequence in a
UTF-8 string. Similarly, \X{3} matches three Unicode extended grapheme
clusters, each of which can be many data units long (and they can be of
different lengths).</p><p>The quantifier {0} is permitted, causing the expression to behave as if
the previous item and the quantifier were not present. This can be useful
for subpatterns that are referenced as subroutines from elsewhere in the
pattern (but see also section <a href="#defining_subpatterns"> Defining Subpatterns for Use by Reference Only</a>). Items other
than subpatterns that have a {0} quantifier are omitted from the compiled
pattern.</p><p>For convenience, the three most common quantifiers have single-character
abbreviations:</p><dl><dt>*</dt><dd>Equivalent to {0,}</dd><dt>+</dt><dd>Equivalent to {1,}</dd><dt>?</dt><dd>Equivalent to {0,1}</dd></dl><p>Infinite loops can be constructed by following a subpattern that can
match no characters with a quantifier that has no upper limit, for
example:</p><pre><code class="">
(a?)*</code></pre><p>Earlier versions of Perl and PCRE used to give an error at compile time
for such patterns. However, as there are cases where this can be useful,
such patterns are now accepted. However, if any repetition of the
subpattern matches no characters, the loop is forcibly broken.</p><p>By default, the quantifiers are "greedy", that is, they match as much as
possible (up to the maximum number of permitted times), without causing
the remaining pattern to fail. The classic example of where this gives
problems is in trying to match comments in C programs. These appear
between /* and */. Within the comment, individual * and / characters can
appear. An attempt to match C comments by applying the pattern</p><pre><code class="">
/\*.*\*/</code></pre><p>to the string</p><pre><code class="">
/* first comment */  not comment  /* second comment */</code></pre><p>fails, as it matches the entire string owing to the greediness of the .* 
item.</p><p>However, if a quantifier is followed by a question mark, it ceases to be
greedy, and instead matches the minimum number of times possible, so the
following pattern does the right thing with the C comments:</p><pre><code class="">
/\*.*?\*/</code></pre><p>The meaning of the various quantifiers is not otherwise changed, only
the preferred number of matches. Do not confuse this use of question mark
with its use as a quantifier in its own right. As it has two uses, it can
sometimes appear doubled, as in</p><pre><code class="">
\d??\d</code></pre><p>which matches one digit by preference, but can match two if that is the
only way the remaining pattern matches.</p><p>If option <strong>ungreedy</strong> is set (an option that is not available in
Perl), the quantifiers are not greedy by default, but individual ones can
be made greedy by following them with a question mark. That is, it inverts
the default behavior.</p><p>When a parenthesized subpattern is quantified with a minimum repeat count
that is &gt; 1 or with a limited maximum, more memory is required for the
compiled pattern, in proportion to the size of the minimum or maximum.</p><p>If a pattern starts with .* or .{0,} and option <strong>dotall</strong> (equivalent
to Perl option <strong>/s</strong>) is set, thus allowing the dot to match newlines,
the pattern is implicitly anchored, because whatever follows is tried
against every character position in the subject string. So, there is no
point in retrying the overall match at any position after the first. PCRE
normally treats such a pattern as if it was preceded by \A.</p><p>In cases where it is known that the subject string contains no newlines,
it is worth setting <strong>dotall</strong> to obtain this optimization, or
alternatively using ^ to indicate anchoring explicitly.</p><p>However, there are some cases where the optimization cannot be used. When
.* is inside capturing parentheses that are the subject of a back
reference elsewhere in the pattern, a match at the start can fail where a
later one succeeds. Consider, for example:</p><pre><code class="">
(.*)abc\1</code></pre><p>If the subject is "xyz123abc123", the match point is the fourth
character. Therefore, such a pattern is not implicitly anchored.</p><p>Another case where implicit anchoring is not applied is when the leading
.* is inside an atomic group. Once again, a match at the start can fail
where a later one succeeds. Consider the following pattern:</p><pre><code class="">
(?&gt;.*?a)b</code></pre><p>It matches "ab" in the subject "aab". The use of the backtracking control
verbs (*PRUNE) and (*SKIP) also disable this optimization.</p><p>When a capturing subpattern is repeated, the value captured is the
substring that matched the final iteration. For example, after</p><pre><code class="">
(tweedle[dume]{3}\s*)+</code></pre><p>has matched "tweedledum tweedledee", the value of the captured substring
is "tweedledee". However, if there are nested capturing subpatterns, the
corresponding captured values can have been set in previous iterations.
For example, after</p><pre><code class="">
/(a|(b))+/</code></pre><p>matches "aba", the value of the second captured substring is "b".</p><a name="sect15"></a><h3>Atomic Grouping and Possessive Quantifiers</h3><p>With both maximizing ("greedy") and minimizing ("ungreedy" or "lazy")
repetition, failure of what follows normally causes the repeated item to
be re-evaluated to see if a different number of repeats allows the
remaining pattern to match. Sometimes it is useful to prevent this, either
to change the nature of the match, or to cause it to fail earlier than it
otherwise might, when the author of the pattern knows that there is no
point in carrying on.</p><p>Consider, for example, the pattern \d+foo when applied to the following
subject line:</p><pre><code class="">
123456bar</code></pre><p>After matching all six digits and then failing to match "foo", the normal
action of the matcher is to try again with only five digits matching item
\d+, and then with four, and so on, before ultimately failing. "Atomic
grouping" (a term taken from Jeffrey Friedl's book) provides the means for
specifying that once a subpattern has matched, it is not to be
re-evaluated in this way.</p><p>If atomic grouping is used for the previous example, the matcher gives up
immediately on failing to match "foo" the first time. The notation is a
kind of special parenthesis, starting with <strong>(?&gt;</strong> as in the
following example:</p><pre><code class="">
(?&gt;\d+)foo</code></pre><p>This kind of parenthesis "locks up" the part of the pattern it contains
once it has matched, and a failure further into the pattern is prevented
from backtracking into it. Backtracking past it to previous items,
however, works as normal.</p><p>An alternative description is that a subpattern of this type matches the
string of characters that an identical standalone pattern would match, if
anchored at the current point in the subject string.</p><p>Atomic grouping subpatterns are not capturing subpatterns. Simple cases
such as the above example can be thought of as a maximizing repeat that
must swallow everything it can. So, while both \d+ and \d+? are prepared
to adjust the number of digits they match to make the remaining pattern
match, <strong>(?&gt;\d+)</strong> can only match an entire sequence of digits.</p><p>Atomic groups in general can contain any complicated
subpatterns, and can be nested. However, when the subpattern for an atomic
group is just a single repeated item, as in the example above, a simpler
notation, called a "possessive quantifier" can be used. This consists of
an extra + character following a quantifier. Using this notation, the
previous example can be rewritten as</p><pre><code class="">
\d++foo</code></pre><p>Notice that a possessive quantifier can be used with an entire group,
for example:</p><pre><code class="">
(abc|xyz){2,3}+</code></pre><p>Possessive quantifiers are always greedy; the setting of option
<strong>ungreedy</strong> is ignored. They are a convenient notation for the simpler
forms of an atomic group. However, there is no difference in the meaning
of a possessive quantifier and the equivalent atomic group, but there can
be a performance difference; possessive quantifiers are probably slightly
faster.</p><p>The possessive quantifier syntax is an extension to the Perl 5.8 syntax.
Jeffrey Friedl originated the idea (and the name) in the first edition of
his book. Mike McCloskey liked it, so implemented it when he built the
Sun Java package, and PCRE copied it from there. It ultimately found its
way into Perl at release 5.10.</p><p>PCRE has an optimization that automatically "possessifies" certain simple
pattern constructs. For example, the sequence A+B is treated as A++B, as
there is no point in backtracking into a sequence of A:s when B must
follow.</p><p>When a pattern contains an unlimited repeat inside a subpattern that can
itself be repeated an unlimited number of times, the use of an atomic
group is the only way to avoid some failing matches taking a long time.
The pattern</p><pre><code class="">
(\D+|&lt;\d+&gt;)*[!?]</code></pre><p>matches an unlimited number of substrings that either consist of
non-digits, or digits enclosed in &lt;&gt;, followed by ! or ?. When it
matches, it runs quickly. However, if it is applied to</p><pre><code class="">
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</code></pre><p>it takes a long time before reporting failure. This is because the string
can be divided between the internal \D+ repeat and the external * repeat
in many ways, and all must be tried. (The example uses [!?] rather than a
single character at the end, as both PCRE and Perl have an optimization
that allows for fast failure when a single character is used. They
remember the last single character that is required for a match, and fail
early if it is not present in the string.) If the pattern is changed so
that it uses an atomic group, like the following, sequences of non-digits
cannot be broken, and failure happens quickly:</p><pre><code class="">
((?&gt;\D+)|&lt;\d+&gt;)*[!?]</code></pre><a name="sect16"></a><h3>Back References</h3><p>Outside a character class, a backslash followed by a digit &gt; 0 (and
possibly further digits) is a back reference to a capturing subpattern
earlier (that is, to its left) in the pattern, provided there have been
that many previous capturing left parentheses.</p><p>However, if the decimal number following the backslash is &lt; 10, it is
always taken as a back reference, and causes an error only if there are
not that many capturing left parentheses in the entire pattern. That is,
the parentheses that are referenced do need not be to the left of the
reference for numbers &lt; 10. A "forward back reference" of this type can
make sense when a repetition is involved and the subpattern to the right
has participated in an earlier iteration.</p><p>It is not possible to have a numerical "forward back reference" to a
subpattern whose number is 10 or more using this syntax, as a sequence
such as \50 is interpreted as a character defined in octal. For more
details of the handling of digits following a backslash, see section
<a href="#non_printing_characters">Non-Printing Characters</a> earlier. There is no such problem when named
parentheses are used. A back reference to any subpattern is possible
using named parentheses (see below).</p><p>Another way to avoid the ambiguity inherent in the use of digits
following a backslash is to use the \g escape sequence. This escape must
be followed by an unsigned number or a negative number, optionally
enclosed in braces. The following examples are identical:</p><pre><code class="">
(ring), \1
(ring), \g1
(ring), \g{1}</code></pre><p>An unsigned number specifies an absolute reference without the ambiguity
that is present in the older syntax. It is also useful when literal digits
follow the reference. A negative number is a relative reference. Consider
the following example:</p><pre><code class="">
(abc(def)ghi)\g{-1}</code></pre><p>The sequence \g{-1} is a reference to the most recently started capturing
subpattern before \g, that is, it is equivalent to \2 in this example.
Similarly, \g{-2} would be equivalent to \1. The use of relative
references can be helpful in long patterns, and also in patterns that are
created by joining fragments containing references within themselves.</p><p>A back reference matches whatever matched the capturing subpattern in the
current subject string, rather than anything matching the subpattern
itself (section <a href="#sect21">Subpattern as Subroutines</a> describes a way of doing that). So, the
following pattern matches "sense and sensibility" and "response and
responsibility", but not "sense and responsibility":</p><pre><code class="">
(sens|respons)e and \1ibility</code></pre><p>If caseful matching is in force at the time of the back reference, the
case of letters is relevant. For example, the following matches "rah rah"
and "RAH RAH", but not "RAH rah", although the original capturing
subpattern is matched caselessly:</p><pre><code class="">
((?i)rah)\s+\1</code></pre><p>There are many different ways of writing back references to named
subpatterns. The .NET syntax <strong>\k{name}</strong> and the Perl syntax
<strong>\k&lt;name&gt;</strong> or <strong>\k'name'</strong> are supported, as is the Python
syntax <strong>(?P=name)</strong>. The unified back reference syntax in Perl 5.10,
in which \g can be used for both numeric and named references, is also
supported. The previous example can be rewritten in the following
ways:</p><pre><code class="">
(?&lt;p1&gt;(?i)rah)\s+\k&lt;p1&gt;
(?'p1'(?i)rah)\s+\k{p1}
(?P&lt;p1&gt;(?i)rah)\s+(?P=p1)
(?&lt;p1&gt;(?i)rah)\s+\g{p1}</code></pre><p>A subpattern that is referenced by name can appear in the pattern before
or after the reference.</p><p>There can be more than one back reference to the same subpattern. If a
subpattern has not been used in a particular match, any back references to
it always fails. For example, the following pattern always fails if it
starts to match "a" rather than "bc":</p><pre><code class="">
(a|(bc))\2</code></pre><p>As there can be many capturing parentheses in a pattern, all digits
following the backslash are taken as part of a potential back reference
number. If the pattern continues with a digit character, some delimiter
must be used to terminate the back reference. If option <strong>extended</strong> is
set, this can be whitespace. Otherwise an empty comment (see section
<a href="#sect19">Comments</a>) can be used.</p><p><em>Recursive Back References</em></p><p>A back reference that occurs inside the parentheses to which it refers
fails when the subpattern is first used, so, for example, (a\1) never
matches. However, such references can be useful inside repeated
subpatterns. For example, the following pattern matches any number of
"a"s and also "aba", "ababbaa", and so on:</p><pre><code class="">
(a|b\1)+</code></pre><p>At each iteration of the subpattern, the back reference matches the
character string corresponding to the previous iteration. In order for
this to work, the pattern must be such that the first iteration does not
need to match the back reference. This can be done using alternation, as
in the example above, or by a quantifier with a minimum of zero.</p><p>Back references of this type cause the group that they reference to be
treated as an atomic group. Once the whole group has been matched, a
subsequent matching failure cannot cause backtracking into the middle of
the group.</p><a name="sect17"></a><h3>Assertions</h3><p>An assertion is a test on the characters following or preceding the
current matching point that does not consume any characters. The simple
assertions coded as \b, \B, \A, \G, \Z, \z, ^, and $ are described in
the previous sections.</p><p>More complicated assertions are coded as subpatterns. There are two
kinds: those that look ahead of the current position in the subject
string, and those that look behind it. An assertion subpattern is matched
in the normal way, except that it does not cause the current matching
position to be changed.</p><p>Assertion subpatterns are not capturing subpatterns. If such an assertion
contains capturing subpatterns within it, these are counted for the
purposes of numbering the capturing subpatterns in the whole pattern.
However, substring capturing is done only for positive assertions. (Perl
sometimes, but not always, performs capturing in negative assertions.)</p><div class="alert alert-warning"><h4 class="alert-heading">Warning</h4><p>If a positive assertion containing one or more capturing subpatterns
succeeds, but failure to match later in the pattern causes backtracking over
this assertion, the captures within the assertion are reset only if no higher
numbered captures are already set. This is, unfortunately, a fundamental
limitation of the current implementation, and as PCRE1 is now in
maintenance-only status, it is unlikely ever to change.</p></div><p>For compatibility with Perl, assertion subpatterns can be repeated.
However, it makes no sense to assert the same thing many times, the side
effect of capturing parentheses can occasionally be useful. In practice,
there are only three cases:</p><ul><li> <p>If the quantifier is {0}, the assertion is never obeyed during
matching. However, it can contain internal capturing parenthesized
groups that are called from elsewhere through the subroutine
mechanism.</p> </li><li> <p>If quantifier is {0,n}, where n &gt; 0, it is treated as if it was
{0,1}. At runtime, the remaining pattern match is tried with and
without the assertion, the order depends on the greediness of the
quantifier.</p> </li><li> <p>If the minimum repetition is &gt; 0, the quantifier is ignored. The
assertion is obeyed only once when encountered during matching.</p> </li></ul><p><em>Lookahead Assertions</em></p><p>Lookahead assertions start with (?= for positive assertions and (?! for
negative assertions. For example, the following matches a word followed by
a semicolon, but does not include the semicolon in the match:</p><pre><code class="">
\w+(?=;)</code></pre><p>The following matches any occurrence of "foo" that is not followed by
"bar":</p><pre><code class="">
foo(?!bar)</code></pre><p>Notice that the apparently similar pattern</p><pre><code class="">
(?!foo)bar</code></pre><p>does not find an occurrence of "bar" that is preceded by something other
than "foo". It finds any occurrence of "bar" whatsoever, as the assertion
(?!foo) is always true when the next three characters are "bar". A
lookbehind assertion is needed to achieve the other effect.</p><p>If you want to force a matching failure at some point in a pattern, the
most convenient way to do it is with (?!), as an empty string always
matches. So, an assertion that requires there is not to be an empty
string must always fail. The backtracking control verb (*FAIL) or (*F) is
a synonym for (?!).</p><p><em>Lookbehind Assertions</em></p><p>Lookbehind assertions start with (?&lt;= for positive assertions and
(?&lt;! for negative assertions. For example, the following finds an
occurrence of "bar" that is not preceded by "foo":</p><pre><code class="">
(?&lt;!foo)bar</code></pre><p>The contents of a lookbehind assertion are restricted such that all the
strings it matches must have a fixed length. However, if there are many
top-level alternatives, they do not all have to have the same fixed
length. Thus, the following is permitted:</p><pre><code class="">
(?&lt;=bullock|donkey)</code></pre><p>The following causes an error at compile time:</p><pre><code class="">
(?&lt;!dogs?|cats?)</code></pre><p>Branches that match different length strings are permitted only at the
top-level of a lookbehind assertion. This is an extension compared with
Perl, which requires all branches to match the same length of string. An
assertion such as the following is not permitted, as its single top-level
branch can match two different lengths:</p><pre><code class="">
(?&lt;=ab(c|de))</code></pre><p>However, it is acceptable to PCRE if rewritten to use two top-level
branches:</p><pre><code class="">
(?&lt;=abc|abde)</code></pre><p>Sometimes the escape sequence \K (see above) can be used instead of
a lookbehind assertion to get round the fixed-length restriction.</p><p>The implementation of lookbehind assertions is, for each alternative, to
move the current position back temporarily by the fixed length and then
try to match. If there are insufficient characters before the current
position, the assertion fails.</p><p>In a UTF mode, PCRE does not allow the \C escape (which matches a single
data unit even in a UTF mode) to appear in lookbehind assertions, as it
makes it impossible to calculate the length of the lookbehind. The \X and
\R escapes, which can match different numbers of data units, are not
permitted either.</p><p>"Subroutine" calls (see below), such as (?2) or (?&amp;X), are permitted
in lookbehinds, as long as the subpattern matches a fixed-length string.
Recursion, however, is not supported.</p><p>Possessive quantifiers can be used with lookbehind
assertions to specify efficient matching of fixed-length strings at the
end of subject strings. Consider the following simple pattern when applied
to a long string that does not match:</p><pre><code class="">
abcd$</code></pre><p>As matching proceeds from left to right, PCRE looks for each "a" in the
subject and then sees if what follows matches the remaining pattern. If
the pattern is specified as</p><pre><code class="">
^.*abcd$</code></pre><p>the initial .* matches the entire string at first. However, when this
fails (as there is no following "a"), it backtracks to match all but the
last character, then all but the last two characters, and so on. Once
again the search for "a" covers the entire string, from right to left, so
we are no better off. However, if the pattern is written as</p><pre><code class="">
^.*+(?&lt;=abcd)</code></pre><p>there can be no backtracking for the .*+ item; it can match only the
entire string. The subsequent lookbehind assertion does a single test on
the last four characters. If it fails, the match fails immediately. For
long strings, this approach makes a significant difference to the
processing time.</p><p><em>Using Multiple Assertions</em></p><p>Many assertions (of any sort) can occur in succession. For example, the
following matches "foo" preceded by three digits that are not "999":</p><pre><code class="">
(?&lt;=\d{3})(?&lt;!999)foo</code></pre><p>Notice that each of the assertions is applied independently at the same
point in the subject string. First there is a check that the previous
three characters are all digits, and then there is a check that the same
three characters are not "999".  This pattern does <em>not</em> match
"foo" preceded by six characters, the first of which are digits and the
last three of which are not "999". For example, it does not match
"123abcfoo". A pattern to do that is the following:</p><pre><code class="">
(?&lt;=\d{3}...)(?&lt;!999)foo</code></pre><p>This time the first assertion looks at the preceding six characters,
checks that the first three are digits, and then the second assertion
checks that the preceding three characters are not "999".</p><p>Assertions can be nested in any combination. For example, the following
matches an occurrence of "baz" that is preceded by "bar", which in turn is
not preceded by "foo":</p><pre><code class="">
(?&lt;=(?&lt;!foo)bar)baz</code></pre><p>The following pattern matches "foo" preceded by three digits and any
three characters that are not "999":</p><pre><code class="">
(?&lt;=\d{3}(?!999)...)foo</code></pre><a name="sect18"></a><h3>Conditional Subpatterns</h3><p>It is possible to cause the matching process to obey a subpattern
conditionally or to choose between two alternative subpatterns, depending
on the result of an assertion, or whether a specific capturing subpattern
has already been matched. The following are the two possible forms of
conditional subpattern:</p><pre><code class="">
(?(condition)yes-pattern)
(?(condition)yes-pattern|no-pattern)</code></pre><p>If the condition is satisfied, the yes-pattern is used, otherwise the
no-pattern (if present). If more than two alternatives exist in the
subpattern, a compile-time error occurs. Each of the two alternatives can
itself contain nested subpatterns of any form, including conditional
subpatterns; the restriction to two alternatives applies only at the level
of the condition. The following pattern fragment is an example where the
alternatives are complex:</p><pre><code class="">
(?(1) (A|B|C) | (D | (?(2)E|F) | E) )</code></pre><p>There are four kinds of condition: references to subpatterns, references
to recursion, a pseudo-condition called DEFINE, and assertions.</p><p><em>Checking for a Used Subpattern By Number</em></p><p>If the text between the parentheses consists of a sequence of digits,
the condition is true if a capturing subpattern of that number has
previously matched. If more than one capturing subpattern with the same
number exists (see section <a href="#sect12"> Duplicate Subpattern Numbers</a> earlier), the condition is true if
any of them have matched. An alternative notation is to precede the
digits with a plus or minus sign. In this case, the subpattern number is
relative rather than absolute. The most recently opened parentheses can be
referenced by (?(-1), the next most recent by (?(-2), and so on. Inside
loops, it can also make sense to refer to subsequent groups. The next
parentheses to be opened can be referenced as (?(+1), and so on. (The
value zero in any of these forms is not used; it provokes a compile-time
error.)</p><p>Consider the following pattern, which contains non-significant whitespace
to make it more readable (assume option <strong>extended</strong>) and to divide it
into three parts for ease of discussion:</p><pre><code class="">
( \( )?    [^()]+    (?(1) \) )</code></pre><p>The first part matches an optional opening parenthesis, and if that
character is present, sets it as the first captured substring. The second
part matches one or more characters that are not parentheses. The third
part is a conditional subpattern that tests whether the first set of
parentheses matched or not. If they did, that is, if subject started with
an opening parenthesis, the condition is true, and so the yes-pattern is
executed and a closing parenthesis is required. Otherwise, as no-pattern
is not present, the subpattern matches nothing. That is, this pattern
matches a sequence of non-parentheses, optionally enclosed in
parentheses.</p><p>If this pattern is embedded in a larger one, a relative reference can be
used:</p><pre><code class="">
...other stuff... ( \( )?    [^()]+    (?(-1) \) ) ...</code></pre><p>This makes the fragment independent of the parentheses in the larger
pattern.</p><p><em>Checking for a Used Subpattern By Name</em></p><p>Perl uses the syntax (?(&lt;name&gt;)...) or (?('name')...) to test for a
used subpattern by name. For compatibility with earlier versions of PCRE,
which had this facility before Perl, the syntax (?(name)...) is also
recognized.</p><p>Rewriting the previous example to use a named subpattern gives:</p><pre><code class="">
(?&lt;OPEN&gt; \( )?    [^()]+    (?(&lt;OPEN&gt;) \) )</code></pre><p>If the name used in a condition of this kind is a duplicate, the test is
applied to all subpatterns of the same name, and is true if any one of
them has matched.</p><p><em>Checking for Pattern Recursion</em></p><p>If the condition is the string (R), and there is no subpattern with the
name R, the condition is true if a recursive call to the whole pattern or
any subpattern has been made. If digits or a name preceded by ampersand
follow the letter R, for example:</p><pre><code class="">
(?(R3)...) or (?(R&amp;name)...)</code></pre><p>the condition is true if the most recent recursion is into a subpattern
whose number or name is given. This condition does not check the entire
recursion stack. If the name used in a condition of this kind is a
duplicate, the test is applied to all subpatterns of the same name, and is
true if any one of them is the most recent recursion.</p><p>At "top-level", all these recursion test conditions are false. The syntax
for recursive patterns is described below.</p><p><em>Defining Subpatterns for Use By Reference Only</em></p><a name="defining_subpatterns"></a><p>If the condition is the string (DEFINE), and there is no subpattern with
the name DEFINE, the condition is always false. In this case, there can be
only one alternative in the subpattern. It is always skipped if control
reaches this point in the pattern. The idea of DEFINE is that it can be
used to define "subroutines" that can be referenced from elsewhere. (The
use of subroutines is described below.) For example, a pattern to match
an IPv4 address, such as "192.168.23.245", can be written like this
(ignore whitespace and line breaks):</p><pre><code class="">
(?(DEFINE) (?&lt;byte&gt; 2[0-4]\d | 25[0-5] | 1\d\d | [1-9]?\d) ) \b (?&amp;byte) (\.(?&amp;byte)){3} \b</code></pre><p>The first part of the pattern is a DEFINE group inside which is a another
group named "byte" is defined. This matches an individual component of an
IPv4 address (a number &lt; 256). When matching takes place, this part of
the pattern is skipped, as DEFINE acts like a false condition. The
remaining pattern uses references to the named group to match the four
dot-separated components of an IPv4 address, insisting on a word boundary
at each end.</p><p><em>Assertion Conditions</em></p><p>If the condition is not in any of the above formats, it must be an
assertion. This can be a positive or negative lookahead or lookbehind
assertion. Consider the following pattern, containing non-significant
whitespace, and with the two alternatives on the second line:</p><pre><code class="">
(?(?=[^a-z]*[a-z])
\d{2}-[a-z]{3}-\d{2}  |  \d{2}-\d{2}-\d{2} )</code></pre><p>The condition is a positive lookahead assertion that matches an optional
sequence of non-letters followed by a letter. That is, it tests for the
presence of at least one letter in the subject. If a letter is found, the
subject is matched against the first alternative, otherwise it is matched
against the second. This pattern matches strings in one of the two forms
dd-aaa-dd or dd-dd-dd, where aaa are letters and dd are digits.</p><a name="sect19"></a><h3>Comments</h3><p>There are two ways to include comments in patterns that are processed by
PCRE. In both cases, the start of the comment must not be in a character
class, or in the middle of any other sequence of related characters such
as (?: or a subpattern name or number. The characters that make up a
comment play no part in the pattern matching.</p><p>The sequence (?# marks the start of a comment that continues up to the
next closing parenthesis. Nested parentheses are not permitted. If option
PCRE_EXTENDED is set, an unescaped # character also introduces a comment,
which in this case continues to immediately after the next newline
character or character sequence in the pattern. Which characters are
interpreted as newlines is controlled by the options passed to a
compiling function or by a special sequence at the start of the pattern,
as described in section <a href="#newline_conventions"> Newline Conventions</a> earlier.</p><p>Notice that the end of this type of comment is a literal newline sequence
in the pattern; escape sequences that happen to represent a newline do not
count. For example, consider the following pattern when <strong>extended</strong> is
set, and the default newline convention is in force:</p><pre><code class="">
abc #comment \n still comment</code></pre><p>On encountering character #, <strong>pcre_compile()</strong> skips along, looking
for a newline in the pattern. The sequence \n is still literal at this
stage, so it does not terminate the comment. Only a character with code
value 0x0a (the default newline) does so.</p><a name="sect20"></a><h3>Recursive Patterns</h3><p>Consider the problem of matching a string in parentheses, allowing for
unlimited nested parentheses. Without the use of recursion, the best that
can be done is to use a pattern that matches up to some fixed depth of
nesting. It is not possible to handle an arbitrary nesting depth.</p><p>For some time, Perl has provided a facility that allows regular
expressions to recurse (among other things). It does this by
interpolating Perl code in the expression at runtime, and the code can
refer to the expression itself. A Perl pattern using code interpolation to
solve the parentheses problem can be created like this:</p><pre><code class="">
$re = qr{\( (?: (?&gt;[^()]+) | (?p{$re}) )* \)}x;</code></pre><p>Item (?p{...}) interpolates Perl code at runtime, and in this case refers
recursively to the pattern in which it appears.</p><p>Obviously, PCRE cannot support the interpolation of Perl code. Instead,
it supports special syntax for recursion of the entire pattern, and for
individual subpattern recursion. After its introduction in PCRE and
Python, this kind of recursion was later introduced into Perl at
release 5.10.</p><p>A special item that consists of (? followed by a number &gt; 0 and a
closing parenthesis is a recursive subroutine call of the subpattern of
the given number, if it occurs inside that subpattern. (If not,
it is a non-recursive subroutine call, which is described in the next
section.) The special item (?R) or (?0) is a recursive call of the entire
regular expression.</p><p>This PCRE pattern solves the nested parentheses problem (assume that
option <strong>extended</strong> is set so that whitespace is ignored):</p><pre><code class="">
\( ( [^()]++ | (?R) )* \)</code></pre><p>First it matches an opening parenthesis. Then it matches any number of
substrings, which can either be a sequence of non-parentheses or a
recursive match of the pattern itself (that is, a correctly parenthesized
substring). Finally there is a closing parenthesis. Notice the use of a
possessive quantifier to avoid backtracking into sequences of
non-parentheses.</p><p>If this was part of a larger pattern, you would not want to recurse the
entire pattern, so instead you can use:</p><pre><code class="">
( \( ( [^()]++ | (?1) )* \) )</code></pre><p>The pattern is here within parentheses so that the recursion refers to
them instead of the whole pattern.</p><p>In a larger pattern, keeping track of parenthesis numbers can be tricky.
This is made easier by the use of relative references. Instead of (?1) in
the pattern above, you can write (?-2) to refer to the second most
recently opened parentheses preceding the recursion. That is, a negative
number counts capturing parentheses leftwards from the point at which it
is encountered.</p><p>It is also possible to refer to later opened parentheses, by
writing references such as (?+2). However, these cannot be recursive, as
the reference is not inside the parentheses that are referenced. They are
always non-recursive subroutine calls, as described in the next
section.</p><p>An alternative approach is to use named parentheses instead. The Perl
syntax for this is (?&amp;name). The earlier PCRE syntax (?P&gt;name) is
also supported. We can rewrite the above example as follows:</p><pre><code class="">
(?&lt;pn&gt; \( ( [^()]++ | (?&amp;pn) )* \) )</code></pre><p>If there is more than one subpattern with the same name, the earliest
one is used.</p><p>This particular example pattern that we have studied contains nested
unlimited repeats, and so the use of a possessive quantifier for matching
strings of non-parentheses is important when applying the pattern to
strings that do not match. For example, when this pattern is applied
to</p><pre><code class="">
(aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa()</code></pre><p>it gives "no match" quickly. However, if a possessive quantifier is not
used, the match runs for a long time, as there are so many different
ways the + and * repeats can carve up the subject, and all must be tested
before failure can be reported.</p><p>At the end of a match, the values of capturing parentheses are those from
the outermost level. If the pattern above is matched against</p><pre><code class="">
(ab(cd)ef)</code></pre><p>the value for the inner capturing parentheses (numbered 2) is "ef",
which is the last value taken on at the top-level. If a capturing
subpattern is not matched at the top level, its final captured value is
unset, even if it was (temporarily) set at a deeper level during the
matching process.</p><p>Do not confuse item (?R) with condition (R), which tests for recursion.
Consider the following pattern, which matches text in angle brackets,
allowing for arbitrary nesting. Only digits are allowed in nested brackets
(that is, when recursing), while any characters are permitted at the
outer level.</p><pre><code class="">
&lt; (?: (?(R) \d++  | [^&lt;&gt;]*+) | (?R)) * &gt;</code></pre><p>Here (?(R) is the start of a conditional subpattern, with two different
alternatives for the recursive and non-recursive cases. Item (?R) is the
actual recursive call.</p><p><em>Differences in Recursion Processing between PCRE and Perl</em></p><p>Recursion processing in PCRE differs from Perl in two important ways. In
PCRE (like Python, but unlike Perl), a recursive subpattern call is always
treated as an atomic group. That is, once it has matched some of the
subject string, it is never re-entered, even if it contains untried
alternatives and there is a subsequent matching failure. This can be
illustrated by the following pattern, which means to match a palindromic
string containing an odd number of characters (for example, "a", "aba",
"abcba", "abcdcba"):</p><pre><code class="">
^(.|(.)(?1)\2)$</code></pre><p>The idea is that it either matches a single character, or two identical
characters surrounding a subpalindrome. In Perl, this pattern works; in
PCRE it does not work if the pattern is longer than three characters.
Consider the subject string "abcba".</p><p>At the top level, the first character is matched, but as it is not at
the end of the string, the first alternative fails, the second
alternative is taken, and the recursion kicks in. The recursive call to
subpattern 1 successfully matches the next character ("b"). (Notice that
the beginning and end of line tests are not part of the recursion.)</p><p>Back at the top level, the next character ("c") is compared with what
subpattern 2 matched, which was "a". This fails. As the recursion is
treated as an atomic group, there are now no backtracking points, and so
the entire match fails. (Perl can now re-enter the recursion
and try the second alternative.) However, if the pattern is written with
the alternatives in the other order, things are different:</p><pre><code class="">
^((.)(?1)\2|.)$</code></pre><p>This time, the recursing alternative is tried first, and continues to
recurse until it runs out of characters, at which point the recursion
fails. But this time we have another alternative to try at the higher
level. That is the significant difference: in the previous case the
remaining alternative is at a deeper recursion level, which PCRE cannot
use.</p><p>To change the pattern so that it matches all palindromic strings, not
only those with an odd number of characters, it is tempting to change the
pattern to this:</p><pre><code class="">
^((.)(?1)\2|.?)$</code></pre><p>Again, this works in Perl, but not in PCRE, and for the same reason. When
a deeper recursion has matched a single character, it cannot be entered
again to match an empty string. The solution is to separate the two cases,
and write out the odd and even cases as alternatives at the higher
level:</p><pre><code class="">
^(?:((.)(?1)\2|)|((.)(?3)\4|.))</code></pre><p>If you want to match typical palindromic phrases, the pattern must ignore
all non-word characters, which can be done as follows:</p><pre><code class="">
^\W*+(?:((.)\W*+(?1)\W*+\2|)|((.)\W*+(?3)\W*+\4|\W*+.\W*+))\W*+$</code></pre><p>If run with option <strong>caseless</strong>, this pattern matches phrases such as
"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama!" and it works well in both PCRE and Perl.
Notice the use of the possessive quantifier *+ to avoid backtracking into
sequences of non-word characters. Without this, PCRE takes much longer
(10 times or more) to match typical phrases, and Perl takes so long that
you think it has gone into a loop.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>The palindrome-matching patterns above work only if the subject string
does not start with a palindrome that is shorter than the entire string.
For example, although "abcba" is correctly matched, if the subject is
"ababa", PCRE finds palindrome "aba" at the start, and then fails at top
level, as the end of the string does not follow. Once again, it cannot
jump back into the recursion to try other alternatives, so the entire
match fails.</p></div><p>The second way in which PCRE and Perl differ in their recursion
processing is in the handling of captured values. In Perl, when a
subpattern is called recursively or as a subpattern (see the next
section), it has no access to any values that were captured outside the
recursion. In PCRE these values can be referenced. Consider the following
pattern:</p><pre><code class="">
^(.)(\1|a(?2))</code></pre><p>In PCRE, it matches "bab". The first capturing parentheses match "b",
then in the second group, when the back reference \1 fails to match "b",
the second alternative matches "a", and then recurses. In the recursion,
\1 does now match "b" and so the whole match succeeds. In Perl, the
pattern fails to match because inside the recursive call \1 cannot access
the externally set value.</p><a name="sect21"></a><h3>Subpatterns as Subroutines</h3><p>If the syntax for a recursive subpattern call (either by number or by
name) is used outside the parentheses to which it refers, it operates
like a subroutine in a programming language. The called subpattern can be
defined before or after the reference. A numbered reference can be
absolute or relative, as in the following examples:</p><pre><code class="">
(...(absolute)...)...(?2)...
(...(relative)...)...(?-1)...
(...(?+1)...(relative)...</code></pre><p>An earlier example pointed out that the following pattern matches "sense
and sensibility" and "response and responsibility", but not "sense and
responsibility":</p><pre><code class="">
(sens|respons)e and \1ibility</code></pre><p>If instead the following pattern is used, it matches "sense and
responsibility" and the other two strings:</p><pre><code class="">
(sens|respons)e and (?1)ibility</code></pre><p>Another example is provided in the discussion of DEFINE earlier.</p><p>All subroutine calls, recursive or not, are always treated as atomic
groups. That is, once a subroutine has matched some of the subject string,
it is never re-entered, even if it contains untried alternatives and there
is a subsequent matching failure. Any capturing parentheses that are set
during the subroutine call revert to their previous values afterwards.</p><p>Processing options such as case-independence are fixed when a subpattern
is defined, so if it is used as a subroutine, such options cannot be
changed for different calls. For example, the following pattern matches
"abcabc" but not "abcABC", as the change of processing option does not
affect the called subpattern:</p><pre><code class="">
(abc)(?i:(?-1))</code></pre><a name="sect22"></a><h3>Oniguruma Subroutine Syntax</h3><p>For compatibility with Oniguruma, the non-Perl syntax \g followed by a
name or a number enclosed either in angle brackets or single quotes, is
alternative syntax for referencing a subpattern as a subroutine, possibly
recursively. Here follows two of the examples used above, rewritten using
this syntax:</p><pre><code class="">
(?&lt;pn&gt; \( ( (?&gt;[^()]+) | \g&lt;pn&gt; )* \) )
(sens|respons)e and \g'1'ibility</code></pre><p>PCRE supports an extension to Oniguruma: if a number is preceded by a
plus or minus sign, it is taken as a relative reference, for example:</p><pre><code class="">
(abc)(?i:\g&lt;-1&gt;)</code></pre><p>Notice that \g{...} (Perl syntax) and \g&lt;...&gt; (Oniguruma syntax)
are <em>not</em> synonymous. The former is a back reference; the latter
is a subroutine call.</p><a name="sect23"></a><h3>Backtracking Control</h3><p>Perl 5.10 introduced some "Special Backtracking Control Verbs",
which are still described in the Perl documentation as "experimental and
subject to change or removal in a future version of Perl". It goes on to
say: "Their usage in production code should be noted to avoid problems
during upgrades." The same remarks apply to the PCRE features described
in this section.</p><p>The new verbs make use of what was previously invalid syntax: an opening
parenthesis followed by an asterisk. They are generally of the form
(*VERB) or (*VERB:NAME). Some can take either form, possibly behaving
differently depending on whether a name is present. A name is any sequence
of characters that does not include a closing parenthesis. The maximum
name length is 255 in the 8-bit library and 65535 in the 16-bit and 32-bit
libraries. If the name is empty, that is, if the closing parenthesis
immediately follows the colon, the effect is as if the colon was not
there. Any number of these verbs can occur in a pattern.</p><p>The behavior of these verbs in repeated groups, assertions, and in
subpatterns called as subroutines (whether or not recursively) is
described below.</p><p><em>Optimizations That Affect Backtracking Verbs</em></p><p>PCRE contains some optimizations that are used to speed up matching by
running some checks at the start of each match attempt. For example, it
can know the minimum length of matching subject, or that a particular
character must be present. When one of these optimizations bypasses the
running of a match, any included backtracking verbs are not processed.
processed. You can suppress the start-of-match optimizations by setting
option <strong>no_start_optimize</strong> when calling
<a href="#compile/2">compile/2</a> or
<a href="#run/3">run/3</a>, or by starting the
pattern with (*NO_START_OPT).</p><p>Experiments with Perl suggest that it too has similar optimizations,
sometimes leading to anomalous results.</p><p><em>Verbs That Act Immediately</em></p><p>The following verbs act as soon as they are encountered. They must not
be followed by a name.</p><pre><code class="">
(*ACCEPT)</code></pre><p>This verb causes the match to end successfully, skipping the remainder of
the pattern. However, when it is inside a subpattern that is called as a
subroutine, only that subpattern is ended successfully. Matching then
continues at the outer level. If (*ACCEPT) is triggered in a positive
assertion, the assertion succeeds; in a negative assertion, the assertion
fails.</p><p>If (*ACCEPT) is inside capturing parentheses, the data so far is
captured. For example, the following matches "AB", "AAD", or "ACD". When
it matches "AB", "B" is captured by the outer parentheses.</p><pre><code class="">
A((?:A|B(*ACCEPT)|C)D)</code></pre><p>The following verb causes a matching failure, forcing backtracking to
occur. It is equivalent to (?!) but easier to read.</p><pre><code class="">
(*FAIL) or (*F)</code></pre><p>The Perl documentation states that it is probably useful only when
combined with (?{}) or (??{}). Those are Perl features that
are not present in PCRE.</p><p>A match with the string "aaaa" always fails, but the callout is taken
before each backtrack occurs (in this example, 10 times).</p><p><em>Recording Which Path Was Taken</em></p><p>The main purpose of this verb is to track how a match was arrived at,
although it also has a secondary use in with advancing the match
starting point (see (*SKIP) below).</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>In Erlang, there is no interface to retrieve a mark with
<a href="#run/2">run/2</a>, so only the secondary
purpose is relevant to the Erlang programmer.</p><p>The rest of this section is therefore deliberately not adapted for
reading by the Erlang programmer, but the examples can help in
understanding NAMES as they can be used by (*SKIP).</p></div><pre><code class="">
(*MARK:NAME) or (*:NAME)</code></pre><p>A name is always required with this verb. There can be as many instances
of (*MARK) as you like in a pattern, and their names do not have to be
unique.</p><p>When a match succeeds, the name of the last encountered (*MARK:NAME),
(*PRUNE:NAME), or (*THEN:NAME) on the matching path is passed back to the
caller as described in section "Extra data for <strong>pcre_exec()</strong>" in the
<strong>pcreapi</strong> documentation. In the following example of <strong>pcretest</strong>
output, the /K modifier requests the retrieval and outputting of (*MARK)
data:</p><pre><code class="">
  re&gt; /X(*MARK:A)Y|X(*MARK:B)Z/K
data&gt; XY
 0: XY
MK: A
XZ
 0: XZ
MK: B</code></pre><p>The (*MARK) name is tagged with "MK:" in this output, and in this example
it indicates which of the two alternatives matched. This is a more
efficient way of obtaining this information than putting each alternative
in its own capturing parentheses.</p><p>If a verb with a name is encountered in a positive assertion that is
true, the name is recorded and passed back if it is the last encountered.
This does not occur for negative assertions or failing positive
assertions.</p><p>After a partial match or a failed match, the last encountered name in the
entire match process is returned, for example:</p><pre><code class="">
  re&gt; /X(*MARK:A)Y|X(*MARK:B)Z/K
data&gt; XP
No match, mark = B</code></pre><p>Notice that in this unanchored example, the mark is retained from the
match attempt that started at letter "X" in the subject. Subsequent match
attempts starting at "P" and then with an empty string do not get as far
as the (*MARK) item, nevertheless do not reset it.</p><p><em>Verbs That Act after Backtracking</em></p><p>The following verbs do nothing when they are encountered. Matching
continues with what follows, but if there is no subsequent match, causing
a backtrack to the verb, a failure is forced. That is, backtracking cannot
pass to the left of the verb. However, when one of these verbs appears
inside an atomic group or an assertion that is true, its effect is
confined to that group, as once the group has been matched, there is never
any backtracking into it. In this situation, backtracking can "jump back"
to the left of the entire atomic group or assertion. (Remember also, as
stated above, that this localization also applies in subroutine
calls.)</p><p>These verbs differ in exactly what kind of failure occurs when
backtracking reaches them. The behavior described below is what occurs
when the verb is not in a subroutine or an assertion. Subsequent sections
cover these special cases.</p><p>The following verb, which must not be followed by a name, causes the
whole match to fail outright if there is a later matching failure that
causes backtracking to reach it. Even if the pattern is unanchored, no
further attempts to find a match by advancing the starting point take
place.</p><pre><code class="">
(*COMMIT)</code></pre><p>If (*COMMIT) is the only backtracking verb that is encountered, once it
has been passed, <a href="#run/2">run/2</a> is
committed to find a match at the current starting point, or not at all,
for example:</p><pre><code class="">
a+(*COMMIT)b</code></pre><p>This matches "xxaab" but not "aacaab". It can be thought of as a kind of
dynamic anchor, or "I've started, so I must finish". The name of the most
recently passed (*MARK) in the path is passed back when (*COMMIT) forces
a match failure.</p><p>If more than one backtracking verb exists in a pattern, a different one
that follows (*COMMIT) can be triggered first, so merely passing (*COMMIT)
during a match does not always guarantee that a match must be at this
starting point.</p><p>Notice that (*COMMIT) at the start of a pattern is not the same as an
anchor, unless the PCRE start-of-match optimizations are turned off, as
shown in the following example:</p><pre><code class="">
1&gt; re:run("xyzabc","(*COMMIT)abc",[{capture,all,list}]).
{match,["abc"]}
2&gt; re:run("xyzabc","(*COMMIT)abc",[{capture,all,list},no_start_optimize]).
nomatch</code></pre><p>For this pattern, PCRE knows that any match must start with "a", so the
optimization skips along the subject to "a" before applying the pattern to the
first set of data. The match attempt then succeeds. In the second call the
<strong>no_start_optimize</strong> disables the optimization that skips along to the
first character. The pattern is now applied starting at "x", and so the
(*COMMIT) causes the match to fail without trying any other starting
points.</p><p>The following verb causes the match to fail at the current starting
position in the subject if there is a later matching failure that causes
backtracking to reach it:</p><pre><code class="">
(*PRUNE) or (*PRUNE:NAME)</code></pre><p>If the pattern is unanchored, the normal "bumpalong" advance to the next
starting character then occurs. Backtracking can occur as usual to the
left of (*PRUNE), before it is reached, or when matching to the right of
(*PRUNE), but if there is no match to the right, backtracking cannot
cross (*PRUNE). In simple cases, the use of (*PRUNE) is just an
alternative to an atomic group or possessive quantifier, but there are
some uses of (*PRUNE) that cannot be expressed in any other way. In an
anchored pattern, (*PRUNE) has the same effect as (*COMMIT).</p><p>The behavior of (*PRUNE:NAME) is the not the same as
(*MARK:NAME)(*PRUNE). It is like (*MARK:NAME) in that the name is
remembered for passing back to the caller. However, (*SKIP:NAME) searches
only for names set with (*MARK).</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>The fact that (*PRUNE:NAME) remembers the name is useless to the Erlang
programmer, as names cannot be retrieved.</p></div><p>The following verb, when specified without a name, is like (*PRUNE),
except that if the pattern is unanchored, the "bumpalong" advance is not
to the next character, but to the position in the subject where (*SKIP)
was encountered.</p><pre><code class="">
(*SKIP)</code></pre><p>(*SKIP) signifies that whatever text was matched leading up to it cannot
be part of a successful match. Consider:</p><pre><code class="">
a+(*SKIP)b</code></pre><p>If the subject is "aaaac...", after the first match attempt fails
(starting at the first character in the string), the starting point skips
on to start the next attempt at "c". Notice that a possessive quantifier
does not have the same effect as this example; although it would suppress
backtracking during the first match attempt, the second attempt would
start at the second character instead of skipping on to "c".</p><p>When (*SKIP) has an associated name, its behavior is modified:</p><pre><code class="">
(*SKIP:NAME)</code></pre><p>When this is triggered, the previous path through the pattern is searched
for the most recent (*MARK) that has the same name. If one is found, the
"bumpalong" advance is to the subject position that corresponds to that
(*MARK) instead of to where (*SKIP) was encountered. If no (*MARK) with a
matching name is found, (*SKIP) is ignored.</p><p>Notice that (*SKIP:NAME) searches only for names set by (*MARK:NAME). It
ignores names that are set by (*PRUNE:NAME) or (*THEN:NAME).</p><p>The following verb causes a skip to the next innermost alternative when
backtracking reaches it. That is, it cancels any further backtracking
within the current alternative.</p><pre><code class="">
(*THEN) or (*THEN:NAME)</code></pre><p>The verb name comes from the observation that it can be used for a
pattern-based if-then-else block:</p><pre><code class="">
( COND1 (*THEN) FOO | COND2 (*THEN) BAR | COND3 (*THEN) BAZ ) ...</code></pre><p>If the COND1 pattern matches, FOO is tried (and possibly further items
after the end of the group if FOO succeeds). On failure, the matcher skips
to the second alternative and tries COND2, without backtracking into
COND1. If that succeeds and BAR fails, COND3 is tried. If BAZ then fails,
there are no more alternatives, so there is a backtrack to whatever
came before the entire group. If (*THEN) is not inside an alternation, it
acts like (*PRUNE).</p><p>The behavior of (*THEN:NAME) is the not the same as (*MARK:NAME)(*THEN).
It is like (*MARK:NAME) in that the name is remembered for passing back to
the caller. However, (*SKIP:NAME) searches only for names set with
(*MARK).</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>The fact that (*THEN:NAME) remembers the name is useless to the Erlang
programmer, as names cannot be retrieved.</p></div><p>A subpattern that does not contain a | character is just a part of the
enclosing alternative; it is not a nested alternation with only one
alternative. The effect of (*THEN) extends beyond such a subpattern to the
enclosing alternative. Consider the following pattern, where A, B, and so
on, are complex pattern fragments that do not contain any | characters at
this level:</p><pre><code class="">
A (B(*THEN)C) | D</code></pre><p>If A and B are matched, but there is a failure in C, matching does not
backtrack into A; instead it moves to the next alternative, that is, D.
However, if the subpattern containing (*THEN) is given an alternative, it
behaves differently:</p><pre><code class="">
A (B(*THEN)C | (*FAIL)) | D</code></pre><p>The effect of (*THEN) is now confined to the inner subpattern. After a
failure in C, matching moves to (*FAIL), which causes the whole subpattern
to fail, as there are no more alternatives to try. In this case, matching
does now backtrack into A.</p><p>Notice that a conditional subpattern is not considered as having two
alternatives, as only one is ever used. That is, the | character in a
conditional subpattern has a different meaning. Ignoring whitespace,
consider:</p><pre><code class="">
^.*? (?(?=a) a | b(*THEN)c )</code></pre><p>If the subject is "ba", this pattern does not match. As .*? is ungreedy,
it initially matches zero characters. The condition (?=a) then fails, the
character "b" is matched, but "c" is not. At this point, matching does not
backtrack to .*? as can perhaps be expected from the presence of the |
character. The conditional subpattern is part of the single alternative
that comprises the whole pattern, and so the match fails. (If there was a
backtrack into .*?, allowing it to match "b", the match would
succeed.)</p><p>The verbs described above provide four different "strengths" of control
when subsequent matching fails:</p><ul><li> <p>(*THEN) is the weakest, carrying on the match at the next
alternative.</p> </li><li> <p>(*PRUNE) comes next, fails the match at the current starting
position, but allows an advance to the next character (for an
unanchored pattern).</p> </li><li> <p>(*SKIP) is similar, except that the advance can be more than one
character.</p> </li><li> <p>(*COMMIT) is the strongest, causing the entire match to fail.</p> </li></ul><p><em>More than One Backtracking Verb</em></p><p>If more than one backtracking verb is present in a pattern, the one that
is backtracked onto first acts. For example, consider the following
pattern, where A, B, and so on, are complex pattern fragments:</p><pre><code class="">
(A(*COMMIT)B(*THEN)C|ABD)</code></pre><p>If A matches but B fails, the backtrack to (*COMMIT) causes the entire
match to fail. However, if A and B match, but C fails, the backtrack to
(*THEN) causes the next alternative (ABD) to be tried. This behavior is
consistent, but is not always the same as in Perl. It means that if two or
more backtracking verbs appear in succession, the last of them has no
effect. Consider the following example:</p><pre><code class="">
...(*COMMIT)(*PRUNE)...</code></pre><p>If there is a matching failure to the right, backtracking onto (*PRUNE)
causes it to be triggered, and its action is taken. There can never be a
backtrack onto (*COMMIT).</p><p><em>Backtracking Verbs in Repeated Groups</em></p><p>PCRE differs from Perl in its handling of backtracking verbs in repeated
groups. For example, consider:</p><pre><code class="">
/(a(*COMMIT)b)+ac/</code></pre><p>If the subject is "abac", Perl matches, but PCRE fails because the
(*COMMIT) in the second repeat of the group acts.</p><p><em>Backtracking Verbs in Assertions</em></p><p>(*FAIL) in an assertion has its normal effect: it forces an immediate
backtrack.</p><p>(*ACCEPT) in a positive assertion causes the assertion to succeed without
any further processing. In a negative assertion, (*ACCEPT) causes the
assertion to fail without any further processing.</p><p>The other backtracking verbs are not treated specially if they appear in
a positive assertion. In particular, (*THEN) skips to the next alternative
in the innermost enclosing group that has alternations, regardless if this
is within the assertion.</p><p>Negative assertions are, however, different, to ensure that changing a
positive assertion into a negative assertion changes its result.
Backtracking into (*COMMIT), (*SKIP), or (*PRUNE) causes a negative
assertion to be true, without considering any further alternative branches
in the assertion. Backtracking into (*THEN) causes it to skip to the next
enclosing alternative within the assertion (the normal behavior), but if
the assertion does not have such an alternative, (*THEN) behaves like
(*PRUNE).</p><p><em>Backtracking Verbs in Subroutines</em></p><p>These behaviors occur regardless if the subpattern is called recursively.
The treatment of subroutines in Perl is different in some cases.</p><ul><li> <p>(*FAIL) in a subpattern called as a subroutine has its normal effect:
it forces an immediate backtrack.</p> </li><li> <p>(*ACCEPT) in a subpattern called as a subroutine causes the
subroutine match to succeed without any further processing. Matching
then continues after the subroutine call.</p> </li><li> <p>(*COMMIT), (*SKIP), and (*PRUNE) in a subpattern called as a
subroutine cause the subroutine match to fail.</p> </li><li> <p>(*THEN) skips to the next alternative in the innermost enclosing
group within the subpattern that has alternatives. If there is no such
group within the subpattern, (*THEN) causes the subroutine match to
fail.</p> </li></ul><h2>sets</h2><p>Functions for set manipulation.</p><p>Sets are collections of elements with no duplicate elements.

<a href="ordsets">ordsets</a></p><h2>shell</h2><p>The Erlang shell.</p><p>This module provides an Erlang shell.The shell is a user interface program
for entering expression sequences. The expressions are
evaluated and a value is returned.
A history mechanism saves previous commands and their
values, which can then be incorporated in later commands.
How many commands and results to save can be determined by the user,
either interactively, by calling
<a href="#history/1">history/1</a> and
<a href="#results/1">results/1</a>,
or by setting the application configuration
parameters <strong>shell_history_length</strong> and
<strong>shell_saved_results</strong> for the STDLIB application.The shell uses a helper process for evaluating commands
to protect the history mechanism from exceptions. By
default the evaluator process is killed when an exception
occurs, but by calling <a href="#catch_exception/1">catch_exception/1</a> or by
setting the application configuration parameter
<strong>shell_catch_exception</strong> for the STDLIB application
this behavior can be changed. See also the example below.Variable bindings, and local process dictionary changes
that are generated in user expressions are preserved, and the variables
can be used in later commands to access their values. The
bindings can also be forgotten so the variables can be reused.The special shell commands all have the syntax of (local)
function calls. They are evaluated as
normal function calls and many commands can be used in one
expression sequence.If a command (local function call) is not recognized by the
shell, an attempt is first made to find the function in
module <strong>user_default</strong>, where customized local commands
can be placed. If found, the function is evaluated,
otherwise an attempt is made to evaluate the function in
module <strong>shell_default</strong>. Module
<strong>user_default</strong> must be explicitly loaded.The shell also permits the user to start multiple concurrent
jobs. A job can be regarded as a set of processes that can
communicate with the shell.There is some support for reading and printing records in
the shell. During compilation record expressions are translated
to tuple expressions. In runtime it is not known whether a tuple
represents a record, and the record definitions
used by the compiler are unavailable at runtime. So, to read the
record syntax and print tuples as records when possible, record
definitions must be maintained by the shell itself.The shell commands for reading, defining, forgetting, listing, and
printing records are described below. Notice that each job has its
own set of record definitions. To facilitate matters, record
definitions in modules <strong>shell_default</strong> and
<strong>user_default</strong> (if loaded) are read each time a new job is
started. For example, adding the following line
to <strong>user_default</strong> makes the definition of <strong>file_info</strong>
readily available in the shell:<pre><code class="">
-include_lib("kernel/include/file.hrl").</code></pre>The shell runs in two modes:<ul><li> <p><strong>Normal (possibly restricted)</strong> mode, in which
commands can be edited and expressions evaluated</p> </li><li> <p>Job Control Mode, <strong>JCL</strong>, in which jobs can be
started, killed, detached, and connected</p> </li></ul>Only the currently connected job can 'talk' to the shell.</p><h3>Shell Commands</h3><dl><dt><strong>b()</strong></dt><dd> <p>Prints the current variable bindings.</p> </dd><dt><strong>f()</strong></dt><dd> <p>Removes all variable bindings.</p> </dd><dt><strong>f(X)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Removes the binding of variable <strong>X</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>h()</strong></dt><dd> <p>Prints the history list.</p> </dd><dt><strong>history(N)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Sets the number of previous commands to keep in the

Defaults to 20.</p> </dd><dt><strong>results(N)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Sets the number of results from previous commands to keep in
the history list to <strong>N</strong>. The previous number is returned.
Defaults to 20.</p> </dd><dt><strong>e(N)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Repeats command <strong>N</strong>, if <strong>N</strong> is positive. If
it is negative, the <strong>N</strong>th previous command is repeated
(that is, <strong>e(-1)</strong> repeats the previous command).</p> </dd><dt><strong>v(N)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Uses the return value of command <strong>N</strong> in the
current command, if <strong>N</strong> is positive. If it is negative,
the return value of the <strong>N</strong>th previous command is used
(that is, <strong>v(-1)</strong> uses the value of the previous command).</p> </dd><dt><strong>help()</strong></dt><dd> <p>Evaluates <strong>shell_default:help()</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>c(Mod)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Evaluates <strong>shell_default:c(Mod)</strong>. This compiles and
loads the module <strong>Mod</strong> and purges old versions of the
code, if necessary. <strong>Mod</strong> can be either a module name or a
a source file path, with or without <strong>.erl</strong> extension.</p> </dd><dt><strong>catch_exception(Bool)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Sets the exception handling of the evaluator process. The
previous exception handling is returned. The default
(<strong>false</strong>) is to kill the evaluator process when an
exception occurs, which causes the shell to create a new
evaluator process. When the exception handling is set to
<strong>true</strong>, the evaluator process lives on. This means,
for example, that ports and ETS tables as well as processes
linked to the evaluator process survive the exception.</p> </dd><dt><strong>rd(RecordName, RecordDefinition)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Defines a record in the shell. <strong>RecordName</strong> is
an atom and <strong>RecordDefinition</strong> lists the field names
and the default values. Usually record definitions are made
known to the shell by use of the <strong>rr/1,2,3</strong> commands
described below, but sometimes it is handy to define records
on the fly.</p> </dd><dt><strong>rf()</strong></dt><dd> <p>Removes all record definitions, then reads record
definitions from the modules <strong>shell_default</strong> and
<strong>user_default</strong> (if loaded). Returns the names of the
records defined.</p> </dd><dt><strong>rf(RecordNames)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Removes selected record definitions.
<strong>RecordNames</strong> is a record name or a list of record names.
To remove all record definitions, use <strong>'_'</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>rl()</strong></dt><dd> <p>Prints all record definitions.</p> </dd><dt><strong>rl(RecordNames)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Prints selected record definitions.
<strong>RecordNames</strong> is a record name or a list of record names.</p> </dd><dt><strong>rp(Term)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Prints a term using the record definitions known to the
shell. All of <strong>Term</strong> is printed; the depth is not

there are no record definitions in the BEAM file, the
source file is located and read instead. Returns the names
of the record definitions read. <strong>Module</strong> is an atom.</p> </dd><dt><strong>rr(Wildcard)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Reads record definitions from files. Existing
definitions of any of the record names read are replaced.
<strong>Wildcard</strong> is a wildcard string as defined in
<a href="filelib">filelib</a>,
but not an atom.</p> </dd><dt><strong>rr(WildcardOrModule, RecordNames)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Reads record definitions from files but
discards record names not mentioned in <strong>RecordNames</strong> (a
record name or a list of record names).</p> </dd><dt><strong>rr(WildcardOrModule, RecordNames, Options)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Reads record definitions from files. The compiler
options <strong>{i,Â Dir}</strong>, <strong>{d,Â Macro}</strong>, and

To read all record definitions, use
<strong>'_'</strong> as value of <strong>RecordNames</strong>.</p> </dd></dl><h3>Example</h3><p>The following example is a long dialog with the shell. Commands

process. This process, together with any local processes that
it spawns, is referred to as a <strong>job</strong>. Only the current job,
which is said to be <strong>connected</strong>, can perform operations
with standard I/O. All other jobs, which are said to be <strong>detached</strong>,
are <strong>blocked</strong> if they attempt to use standard I/O.</p><p>All jobs that do not use standard I/O run in the normal way.</p><p>The shell escape key <strong>^G</strong> (Control G) detaches the current
job and activates <strong>JCL</strong> mode. The <strong>JCL</strong> mode prompt is
<strong>"--&gt;"</strong>. If <strong>"?"</strong> is entered at the prompt, the following help
message is displayed:</p><pre>
--&gt; ?
c [nn]            - connect to job
i [nn]            - interrupt job
k [nn]            - kill job
j                 - list all jobs
s [shell]         - start local shell
r [node [shell]]  - start remote shell
q                 - quit erlang
? | h             - this message</pre><p>The <strong>JCL</strong> commands have the following meaning:</p><dl><dt><strong>c [nn]</strong></dt><dd> <p>Connects to job number <strong>&lt;nn&gt;</strong> or the current
job. The standard shell is resumed. Operations that use
standard I/O by the current job are interleaved with
user inputs to the shell.</p> </dd><dt><strong>i [nn]</strong></dt><dd> <p>Stops the current evaluator process for job number
<strong>nn</strong> or the current job, but does not kill the shell
process. So, any variable bindings and the process
dictionary are preserved and the job can be connected again.
This command can be used to interrupt an endless loop.</p> </dd><dt><strong>k [nn]</strong></dt><dd> <p>Kills job number <strong>nn</strong> or the current

distributed Erlang to allow a shell running on one node to

to be a module that implements an alternative shell.</p> </dd><dt><strong>q</strong></dt><dd> <p>Quits Erlang. Notice that this option is disabled if
Erlang is started with the ignore break, <strong>+Bi</strong>,
system flag (which can be useful, for example when running
a restricted shell, see the next section).</p> </dd><dt><strong>?</strong></dt><dd> <p>Displays the help message above.</p> </dd></dl><p>The behavior of shell escape can be changed by the STDLIB
application variable <strong>shell_esc</strong>. The value of
the variable can be either <strong>jcl</strong> (<strong>erl -stdlib shell_esc jcl</strong>) 
or <strong>abort</strong> (<strong>erl -stdlib shell_esc abort</strong>). The 
first option sets <strong>^G</strong> to activate <strong>JCL</strong> mode (which
is also default behavior). The latter sets <strong>^G</strong> to
terminate the current shell and start a new one.
<strong>JCL</strong> mode cannot be invoked when 
<strong>shell_esc</strong> is set to <strong>abort</strong>.</p><p>If you want an Erlang node to have a remote job active from the start
(rather than the default local job), start Erlang with flag
<strong>-remsh</strong>, for example,
<strong>erl -sname this_node -remsh other_node@other_host</strong></p><h3>Restricted Shell</h3><p>The shell can be started in a
restricted mode. In this mode, the shell evaluates a function call
only if allowed. This feature makes it possible to, for example,
prevent a user from accidentally calling a function from the
prompt that could harm a running system (useful in combination
with system flag <strong>+Bi</strong>).</p><p>When the restricted shell evaluates an expression and
encounters a function call or an operator application,
it calls a callback function (with
information about the function call in question). This callback
function returns <strong>true</strong> to let the shell go ahead with the
evaluation, or <strong>false</strong> to abort it. There are two possible
callback functions for the user to implement:</p><ul><li> <p><strong>local_allowed(Func, ArgList, State) -&gt; {boolean(),NewState}</strong></p> <p>This is used to determine if the call to the local function
<strong>Func</strong> with arguments <strong>ArgList</strong> is to be allowed.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>non_local_allowed(FuncSpec, ArgList, State) -&gt; {boolean(),NewState} | {{redirect,NewFuncSpec,NewArgList},NewState}</strong></p> <p>This is used to determine if the call to non-local function
<strong>FuncSpec</strong> (<strong>{Module,Func}</strong> or a fun) with arguments
<strong>ArgList</strong> is to be allowed. The return value
<strong>{redirect,NewFuncSpec,NewArgList}</strong> can be used to let
the shell evaluate some other function than the one specified by
<strong>FuncSpec</strong> and <strong>ArgList</strong>.</p> </li></ul><p>These callback functions are called from local and
non-local evaluation function handlers, described in the
<a href="erl_eval">erl_eval</a> 
manual page. (Arguments in <strong>ArgList</strong> are evaluated before the
callback functions are called.)</p><p>Argument <strong>State</strong> is a tuple
<strong>{ShellState,ExprState}</strong>. The return value <strong>NewState</strong>
has the same form. This can be used to carry a state between calls
to the callback functions. Data saved in <strong>ShellState</strong> lives
through an entire shell session. Data saved in <strong>ExprState</strong>
lives only through the evaluation of the current expression.</p><p>There are two ways to start a restricted shell session:</p><ul><li> <p>Use STDLIB application variable <strong>restricted_shell</strong>
and specify, as its value, the name of the callback
module. Example (with callback functions implemented in
<strong>callback_mod.erl</strong>):
<strong>$ erl -stdlib restricted_shell callback_mod</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p>From a normal shell session, call function
<a href="#start_restricted/1">start_restricted/1</a>. This exits the current evaluator
and starts a new one in restricted mode.</p> </li></ul><p><em>Notes:</em></p><ul><li> <p>When restricted shell mode is activated or
deactivated, new jobs started on the node run in restricted
or normal mode, respectively.</p> </li><li> <p>If restricted mode has been enabled on a
particular node, remote shells connecting to this node also
run in restricted mode.</p> </li><li> <p>The callback functions cannot be used to allow or disallow
execution of functions called from compiled code (only functions
called from expressions entered at the shell prompt).</p> </li></ul><p>Errors when loading the callback module is handled in different
ways depending on how the restricted shell is activated:</p><ul><li> <p>If the restricted shell is activated by setting the STDLIB
variable during emulator startup, and the callback module cannot be
loaded, a default restricted shell allowing only the commands
<strong>q()</strong> and <strong>init:stop()</strong> is used as fallback.</p> </li><li> <p>If the restricted shell is activated using
<a href="#start_restricted/1">start_restricted/1</a> and the callback module cannot
be loaded, an error report is sent to the error logger and the call
returns <strong>{error,Reason}</strong>.</p> </li></ul><h3>Prompting</h3><p>The default shell prompt function displays the name of the node
(if the node can be part of a distributed system) and the
current command number. The user can customize the prompt
function by calling <a href="#prompt_func/1">prompt_func/1</a> or by setting application
configuration parameter <strong>shell_prompt_func</strong> for the
STDLIB application.</p><p>A customized prompt function is stated as a tuple
<strong>{Mod,Â Func}</strong>. The function is called as
<strong>Mod:Func(L)</strong>, where <strong>L</strong> is a list of key-value pairs
created by the shell. Currently there is only one pair:
<strong>{history, N}</strong>, where <strong>N</strong> is the current command number. The
function is to return a list of characters or an atom. This
constraint is because of the Erlang I/O protocol. Unicode characters
beyond code point 255 are allowed in the list and the atom. Notice
that in restricted mode the call <strong>Mod:Func(L)</strong> must be
allowed or the default shell prompt function is called.</p><h2>Functions</h2><h3>catch_exception(Bool) -&gt; boolean()</h3><p>Set the exception handling of the shell.</p><ul><li><span class="v">Bool = boolean()</span></li></ul><p>Sets the exception handling of the evaluator process. The
previous exception handling is returned. The default
(<strong>false</strong>) is to kill the evaluator process when an
exception occurs, which causes the shell to create a new
evaluator process. When the exception handling is set to
<strong>true</strong>, the evaluator process lives on, which means that,
for example, ports and ETS tables as well as processes
linked to the evaluator process survive the exception.</p><h3>history/1</h3><p>Set the number of previous commands to keep.</p><p>Sets the number of previous commands to keep in the
history list to <strong><span class="anno">N</span></strong>. The previous number is
returned. Defaults to 20.</p><h3>prompt_func/1</h3><p>Set the shell prompt.</p><p>Sets the shell prompt function to <strong><span class="anno">PromptFunc</span></strong>.
The previous prompt function is returned.</p><h3>results/1</h3><p>Set the number of previous results to keep.</p><p>Sets the number of results from previous commands to keep in
the history list to <strong><span class="anno">N</span></strong>. The previous number is
returned. Defaults to 20.</p><h3>start_restricted/1</h3><p>Exit a normal shell and starts a restricted shell.</p><p>Exits a normal shell and starts a restricted shell.
<strong><span class="anno">Module</span></strong> specifies the callback module for the
functions <strong>local_allowed/3</strong> and <strong>non_local_allowed/3</strong>.
The function is meant to be called from the shell.</p><p>If the callback module cannot be loaded, an error tuple is
returned. The <strong><span class="anno">Reason</span></strong> in the error tuple is the one
returned by the code loader when trying to load the code of the
callback module.</p><h3>stop_restricted/0</h3><p>Exit a restricted shell and starts a normal shell.</p><p>Exits a restricted shell and starts a normal shell. The function
is meant to be called from the shell.</p><h3>strings/1</h3><p>Set the shell's string recognition flag.</p><p>Sets pretty printing of lists to <strong><span class="anno">Strings</span></strong>.
The previous value of the flag is returned.</p><p>The flag can also be set by the STDLIB application variable
<strong>shell_strings</strong>. Defaults to
<strong>true</strong>, which means that lists of integers are
printed using the string syntax, when possible. Value
<strong>false</strong> means that no lists are printed using the
string syntax.</p><h2>shell_default</h2><p>Customizing the Erlang environment.</p><p>The functions in this module are called when no module name is
specified in a shell command.Consider the following shell dialog:<pre>
1&gt; <span class="input">lists:reverse("abc").</span>
"cba"
2&gt; <span class="input">c(foo).</span>
{ok, foo}</pre>In command one, module <a href="lists">lists</a> is
called. In command two, no module name is specified. The shell searches
module <strong>user_default</strong> followed by module <strong>shell_default</strong> for
function <strong>c/1</strong>.<strong>shell_default</strong> is intended for "system wide"
customizations to the shell. <strong>user_default</strong> is intended for
"local" or individual user customizations.</p><h3>Hint</h3><p>To add your own commands to the shell, create a module called
<strong>user_default</strong> and add the commands you want. Then add the
following line as the <em>first</em> line in your <strong>.erlang</strong> file in
your home directory.</p><pre>
code:load_abs("$PATH/user_default").</pre><p><strong>$PATH</strong> is the directory where your
<strong>user_default</strong> module can be found.</p><h2>slave</h2><p>Functions for starting and controlling slave nodes.
</p><p>This module provides functions for starting Erlang slave nodes.
All slave nodes that are started by a master terminate
automatically when the master terminates. All terminal output produced
at the slave is sent back to the master node. File I/O is
done through the master.Slave nodes on other hosts than the current one are started with
the <strong>ssh</strong> program. The user must be allowed to <strong>ssh</strong> to
the remote hosts without being prompted for a password. This can
be arranged in a number of ways (for details, see the <strong>ssh</strong>
documentation). A slave node started on the same host
as the master inherits certain environment values from the master,
such as the current directory and the environment variables. For
what can be assumed about the environment when a slave is started
on another host, see the documentation for the <strong>ssh</strong>
program.An alternative to the <strong>ssh</strong> program can be specified on
the command line to
<a href="./erl">erts/erl</a> as follows:<pre>
-rsh Program</pre>Note that the command specified with the <strong>-rsh</strong> flag is
treated as a file name which may contain spaces. It is thus not
possible to include any command line options. The remote node will
be launched as <strong>"$RSH" "$REMOTE_HOSTNAME" erl -detached -noinput ...</strong>, so the
<strong>erl</strong> command must be found in the path on the remote host.The slave node is to use the same file system at the master. At
least, Erlang/OTP is to be installed in the same place on both
computers and the same version of Erlang is to be used.A node running on Windows can only start slave
nodes on the host on which it is running.The master node must be alive.</p><h2>Functions</h2><h3>pseudo([Master | ServerList]) -&gt; ok</h3><p>Start a number of pseudo servers.</p><ul><li><span class="v">Master = node()</span></li><li><span class="v">ServerList = [atom()]</span></li></ul><p>Calls <strong>pseudo(Master, ServerList)</strong>. If you want to start
a node from the command line and set up a number of pseudo
servers, an Erlang runtime system can be started as follows:</p><pre>
% erl -name abc -s slave pseudo klacke@super x --</pre><h3>pseudo/2</h3><p>Start a number of pseudo servers.</p><p>Starts a number of pseudo servers. A pseudo server is a
server with a registered name that does nothing
but pass on all message to the real server that executes at a
master node. A pseudo server is an intermediary that only has
the same registered name as the real server.</p><p>For example, if you have started a slave node <strong>N</strong> and
want to execute <strong>pxw</strong> graphics code on this node, you can
start server <strong>pxw_server</strong> as a pseudo server at
the slave node. This is illustrated as follows:</p><pre><code class="">
rpc:call(N, slave, pseudo, [node(), [pxw_server]]).</code></pre><h3>relay/1</h3><p>Run a pseudo server.</p><p>Runs a pseudo server. This function never returns any value
and the process that executes the function receives
messages. All messages received are simply passed on to
<strong><span class="anno">Pid</span></strong>.</p><h3>start/1</h3><h3>start/2</h3><h3>start/3</h3><p>Start a slave node on a host.</p><p>Starts a slave node on host <strong><span class="anno">Host</span></strong>. Host names
need not necessarily be specified as fully qualified names; short
names can also be used. This is the same condition that
applies to names of distributed Erlang nodes.</p><p>The name of the started node becomes
<strong><span class="anno">Name</span>@<span class="anno">Host</span></strong>. If no
name is provided, the name becomes the same as the node that
executes the call (except the host name part of the node name).</p><p>The slave node resets its <strong>user</strong> process so that all
terminal I/O that is produced at the slave is automatically
relayed to the master. Also, the file process is relayed
to the master.</p><p>Argument <strong><span class="anno">Args</span></strong> is used to set <strong>erl</strong>
command-line arguments. If provided, it is passed to the new
node and can be used for a variety of purposes; see
<a href="./erl">erts/erl</a>.</p><p>As an example, suppose that you want to start a slave node at
host <strong>H</strong> with node name <strong>Name@H</strong> and
want the slave node to have the following properties:</p><ul><li>Directory <strong>Dir</strong> is to be added to the code path.</li><li>The Mnesia directory is to be set to <strong>M</strong>.</li><li>The Unix <strong>DISPLAY</strong> environment variable is to be set to the display of the master node.</li></ul><p>The following code is executed to achieve this:</p><pre><code class="">
E = " -env DISPLAY " ++ net_adm:localhost() ++ ":0 ",
Arg = "-mnesia_dir " ++ M ++ " -pa " ++ Dir ++ E,
slave:start(H, Name, Arg).</code></pre><p>The function returns <strong>{ok, <span class="anno">Node</span>}</strong>, where
<strong><span class="anno">Node</span></strong> is the name of the new node, otherwise
<strong>{error, <span class="anno">Reason</span>}</strong>, where <strong><span class="anno">Reason</span></strong>
can be one of:</p><dl><dt><strong>timeout</strong></dt><dd> <p>The master node failed to get in contact with the slave
node. This can occur in a number of circumstances:</p> <ul><li>Erlang/OTP is not installed on the remote host.</li><li>The file system on the other host has a different structure to the the master.</li><li>The Erlang nodes have different cookies.</li></ul> </dd><dt><strong>no_rsh</strong></dt><dd> <p>No remote shell program was found on the computer. Note
that <strong>ssh</strong> is used by default, but this can be overridden
with the <strong>-rsh</strong> flag.</p> </dd><dt><strong>{already_running, <span class="anno">Node</span>}</strong></dt><dd> <p>A node with name <strong><span class="anno">Name</span>@<span class="anno">Host</span></strong>

relations represented as sets. Intuitively, a set is a
collection of elements; every element belongs to the set, and
the set contains every element.Given a set A and a sentence S(x), where x is a free variable,
a new set B whose elements are exactly those elements of A for
which S(x) holds can be formed, this is denoted BÂ =
{xÂ inÂ AÂ : S(x)}. Sentences are expressed using
the logical operators "for some" (or "there exists"), "for all",
"and", "or", "not". If the existence of a set containing all the
specified elements is known (as is always the case in this
module), this is denoted BÂ = {xÂ : S(x)}.<ul><li> <p>The <em>unordered set</em> containing the elements a, b, and c is
denoted {a,Â b,Â c}. This notation is not to be confused with
tuples.</p> <p>The <em>ordered pair</em> of a and b, with first <em>coordinate</em>
a and second coordinate b, is denoted (a,Â b). An ordered pair
is an <em>ordered set</em> of two elements. In this module, ordered
sets can contain one, two, or more elements, and parentheses are
used to enclose the elements.</p> <p>Unordered sets and ordered sets are orthogonal, again in this
module; there is no unordered set equal to any ordered set.</p> </li><li> <p>The <em>empty set</em> contains no elements.</p> <p>Set A is <a name="equal"></a><em>equal</em> to set B if they
contain the same elements, which is denoted AÂ =Â B. Two
ordered sets are equal if they contain the same number of elements
and have equal elements at each coordinate.</p> <p>Set B is a <a name="subset"></a><em>subset</em> of set A
if A contains all elements that B contains.</p> <p>The <a name="union"></a><em>union</em> of two sets A and B
is the smallest set that contains all elements of A and all elements
of B.</p> <p>The <a name="intersection"></a><em>intersection</em> of two
sets A and B is the set that contains all elements of A that belong
to B.</p> <p>Two sets are <a name="disjoint"></a><em>disjoint</em> if
their intersection is the empty set.</p> <p>The <a name="difference"></a><em>difference</em> of two sets
A and B is the set that contains all elements of A that do not belong
to B.</p> <p>The <a name="symmetric_difference"></a><em>symmetric  difference</em> of two sets is the set that contains those element
that belong to either of the two sets, but not both.</p> <p>The <a name="union_n"></a><em>union</em> of a collection
of sets is the smallest set that contains all the elements that
belong to at least one set of the collection.</p> <p>The <a name="intersection_n"></a><em>intersection</em> of
a non-empty collection of sets is the set that contains all elements
that belong to every set of the collection.</p> </li><li> <p>The <a name="Cartesian_product"></a><em>Cartesian product</em> of two sets X and Y, denoted XÂ ÃÂ Y, is
the set {aÂ : aÂ = (x,Â y) for some xÂ inÂ X and
for some yÂ inÂ Y}.</p> <p>A <a name="relation"></a><em>relation</em> is a subset of
XÂ ÃÂ Y. Let R be a relation. The fact that (x,Â y)
belongs to R is written as xÂ RÂ y. As relations are sets,
the definitions of the last item (subset, union, and so on) apply to
relations as well.</p> <p>The <a name="domain"></a><em>domain</em> of R is the set
{xÂ : xÂ RÂ y for some yÂ inÂ Y}.</p> <p>The <a name="range"></a><em>range</em> of R is the set
{yÂ : xÂ RÂ y for some xÂ inÂ X}.</p> <p>The <a name="converse"></a><em>converse</em> of R is the
set {aÂ : aÂ = (y,Â x) for some
(x,Â y)Â inÂ R}.</p> <p>If A is a subset of X, the <a name="image"></a><em>image</em>
of A under R is the set {yÂ : xÂ RÂ y for some
xÂ inÂ A}. If B is a subset of Y, the
<a name="inverse_image"></a><em>inverse image</em> of B is the
set {xÂ : xÂ RÂ y for some yÂ inÂ B}.</p> <p>If R is a relation from X to Y, and S is a relation from Y to Z, the 
<a name="relative_product"></a><em>relative product</em> of R
and S is the relation T from X to Z defined so that xÂ TÂ z
if and only if there exists an element y in Y such that
xÂ RÂ y and yÂ SÂ z.</p> <p>The <a name="restriction"></a><em>restriction</em> of R to A
is the set S defined so that xÂ SÂ y if and only if there
exists an element x in A such that xÂ RÂ y.</p> <p>If S is a restriction of R to A, then R is an
<a name="extension"></a><em>extension</em> of S to X.</p> <p>If XÂ =Â Y, then R is called a relation <em>in</em> X.</p> <p>The <a name="field"></a><em>field</em> of a relation R in X
is the union of the domain of R and the range of R.</p> <p>If R is a relation in X, and if S is defined so that xÂ SÂ y
if xÂ RÂ y and not xÂ =Â y, then S is the
<a name="strict_relation"></a><em>strict</em> relation
corresponding to R. Conversely, if S is a relation in X, and if R is
defined so that xÂ RÂ y if xÂ SÂ y or xÂ =Â y,
then R is the <a name="weak_relation"></a><em>weak</em>
relation corresponding to S.</p> <p>A relation R in X is <em>reflexive</em> if xÂ RÂ x for every
element x of X, it is <em>symmetric</em> if xÂ RÂ y implies

xÂ RÂ y and yÂ RÂ z imply that xÂ RÂ z.</p> </li><li> <p>A <a name="function"></a><em>function</em> F is a relation,
a subset of XÂ ÃÂ Y, such that the domain of F is equal
to X and such that for every x in X there is a unique element y in Y
with (x,Â y) in F. The latter condition can be formulated as
follows: if xÂ FÂ y and xÂ FÂ z, then yÂ =Â z.
In this module, it is not required that the domain of F is equal to X
for a relation to be considered a function.</p> <p>Instead of writing (x,Â y)Â inÂ F or xÂ FÂ y, we
write F(x)Â =Â y when F is a function, and say that F maps x
onto y, or that the value of F at x is y.</p> <p>As functions are relations, the definitions of the last item (domain,
range, and so on) apply to functions as well.</p> <p>If the converse of a function F is a function F', then F' is called 
the <a name="inverse"></a><em>inverse</em> of F.</p> <p>The relative product of two functions F1 and F2 is called
the <a name="composite"></a><em>composite</em> of F1 and F2
if the range of F1 is a subset of the domain of F2.</p> </li><li> <p>Sometimes, when the range of a function is more important than the
function itself, the function is called a <em>family</em>.</p> <p>The domain of a family is called the <em>index set</em>, and the
range is called the <em>indexed set</em>.</p> <p>If x is a family from I to X, then x[i] denotes the value of the
function at index i. The notation "a family in X" is used for such a
family.</p> <p>When the indexed set is a set of subsets of a set X, we call x a 
<a name="family"></a><em>family of subsets</em> of X.</p> <p>If x is a family of subsets of X, the union of the range of x is
called the <em>union of the family</em> x.</p> <p>If x is non-empty (the index set is non-empty), the <em>intersection of the family</em> x is the intersection of the range of x.</p> <p>In this module, the only families that are considered are families
of subsets of some set X; in the following, the word "family" is
used for such families of subsets.</p> </li><li> <p>A <a name="partition"></a><em>partition</em> of a set X is a
collection S of non-empty subsets of X whose union is X and whose
elements are pairwise disjoint.</p> <p>A relation in a set is an <em>equivalence relation</em> if it is
reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.</p> <p>If R is an equivalence relation in X, and x is an element of X, the 
<a name="equivalence_class"></a><em>equivalence class</em> of
x with respect to R is the set of all those elements y of X for which
xÂ RÂ y holds. The equivalence classes constitute a
partitioning of X. Conversely, if C is a partition of X, the relation
that holds for any two elements of X if they belong to the same
equivalence class, is an equivalence relation induced by the
partition C.</p> <p>If R is an equivalence relation in X, the
<a name="canonical_map"></a><em>canonical map</em> is the
function that maps every element of X onto its equivalence class.</p> </li><li> <p><a name="binary_relation"></a>Relations as defined above
(as sets of ordered pairs) are from now on referred to as <em>binary relations</em>.</p> <p>We call a set of ordered sets (x[1],Â ...,Â x[n]) an
<a name="n_ary_relation"></a><em>(n-ary) relation</em>, and
say that the relation is a subset of the
<a name="Cartesian_product_tuple"></a>Cartesian product
X[1]Â ÃÂ ...Â ÃÂ X[n], where x[i] is
an element of X[i], 1Â &lt;=Â iÂ &lt;=Â n.</p> <p>The <a name="projection"></a><em>projection</em> of an n-ary
relation R onto coordinate i is the set {x[i]Â :
(x[1],Â ...,Â x[i],Â ...,Â x[n]) in R for some
x[j]Â inÂ X[j], 1Â &lt;=Â jÂ &lt;=Â n and
not iÂ =Â j}. The projections of a binary relation R onto the
first and second coordinates are the domain and the range of R,
respectively.</p> <p>The relative product of binary relations can be generalized to n-ary
relations as follows. Let TR be an ordered set
(R[1],Â ...,Â R[n]) of binary relations from X to Y[i]
and S a binary relation from
(Y[1]Â ÃÂ ...Â ÃÂ Y[n]) to Z. The
<a name="tuple_relative_product"></a><em>relative product</em>
of TR and S is the binary relation T from X to Z defined so that
xÂ TÂ z if and only if there exists an element y[i] in Y[i]
for each 1Â &lt;=Â iÂ &lt;=Â n such that
xÂ R[i]Â y[i] and
(y[1],Â ...,Â y[n])Â SÂ z. Now let TR be a an
ordered set (R[1],Â ...,Â R[n]) of binary relations from
X[i] to Y[i] and S a subset of
X[1]Â ÃÂ ...Â ÃÂ X[n].
The <a name="multiple_relative_product"></a><em>multiple relative product</em> of TR and S is defined to be the set
{zÂ : zÂ = ((x[1],Â ...,Â x[n]), (y[1],...,y[n]))
for some (x[1],Â ...,Â x[n])Â inÂ S and for some
(x[i],Â y[i]) in R[i], 1Â &lt;=Â iÂ &lt;=Â n}.</p> <p>The <a name="natural_join"></a><em>natural join</em> of an
n-ary relation R and an m-ary relation S on coordinate i and j is
defined to be the set
{zÂ : zÂ = (x[1],Â ...,Â x[n],Â 
y[1],Â ...,Â y[j-1],Â y[j+1],Â ...,Â y[m])
for some (x[1],Â ...,Â x[n])Â inÂ R and for some
(y[1],Â ...,Â y[m])Â inÂ S such that
x[i]Â =Â y[j]}.</p> </li><li> <p><a name="sets_definition"></a>The sets recognized by this
module are represented by elements of the relation Sets, which is
defined as the smallest set such that:</p> <ul><li> <p>For every atom T, except '_', and for every term X,
(T,Â X) belongs to Sets (<em>atomic sets</em>).</p> </li><li> <p>(['_'],Â []) belongs to Sets (the <em>untyped empty set</em>).</p> </li><li> <p>For every tuple TÂ = {T[1],Â ...,Â T[n]} and
for every tuple XÂ = {X[1],Â ...,Â X[n]}, if
(T[i],Â X[i]) belongs to Sets for every
1Â &lt;=Â iÂ &lt;=Â n, then (T,Â X) belongs
to Sets (<em>ordered sets</em>).</p> </li><li> <p>For every term T, if X is the empty list or a non-empty
sorted list [X[1],Â ...,Â X[n]] without duplicates
such that (T,Â X[i]) belongs to Sets for every
1Â &lt;=Â iÂ &lt;=Â n, then ([T],Â X)
belongs to Sets (<em>typed unordered sets</em>).</p> </li></ul> <p>An <a name="external_set"></a><em>external set</em> is an
element of the range of Sets.</p> <p>A <a name="type"></a><em>type</em> is an element of the
domain of Sets.</p> <p>If S is an element (T,Â X) of Sets, then T is a
<a name="valid_type"></a><em>valid type</em> of X, T is the
type of S, and X is the external set of S.
<a href="#from_term/2">from_term/2</a> creates a
set from a type and an Erlang term turned into an external set.</p> <p>The sets represented by Sets are the elements of the range of
function Set from Sets to Erlang terms and sets of Erlang terms:</p> <ul><li>Set(T,Term)Â = Term, where T is an atom</li><li>Set({T[1],Â ...,Â T[n]},Â {X[1],Â ..., Â X[n]})Â = (Set(T[1],Â X[1]),Â ...,Â  Set(T[n],Â X[n]))</li><li>Set([T],Â [X[1],Â ...,Â X[n]])Â = {Set(T,Â X[1]),Â ...,Â Set(T,Â X[n])}</li><li>Set([T],Â [])Â = {}</li></ul> <p>When there is no risk of confusion, elements of Sets are identified
with the sets they represent. For example, if U is the result of
calling <a href="#union/2">union/2</a> with S1
and S2 as arguments, then U is said to be the union of S1 and S2.
A more precise formulation is that Set(U) is the union of Set(S1)
and Set(S2).</p> </li></ul>The types are used to implement the various conditions that
sets must fulfill. As an example, consider the relative
product of two sets R and S, and recall that the relative
product of R and S is defined if R is a binary relation to Y and
S is a binary relation from Y. The function that implements the
relative product, <a href="#relative_product/2">relative_product/2</a>, checks
that the arguments represent binary relations by matching [{A,B}]
against the type of the first argument (Arg1 say), and [{C,D}]
against the type of the second argument (Arg2 say). The fact
that [{A,B}] matches the type of Arg1 is to be interpreted as
Arg1 representing a binary relation from X to Y, where X is
defined as all sets Set(x) for some element x in Sets the type
of which is A, and similarly for Y. In the same way Arg2 is
interpreted as representing a binary relation from W to Z.
Finally it is checked that B matches C, which is sufficient to
ensure that W is equal to Y. The untyped empty set is handled
separately: its type, ['_'], matches the type of any unordered
set.A few functions of this module

accept an Erlang
function as a means to modify each element of a given unordered
set. <a name="set_fun"></a>Such a function, called
SetFun in the following, can be specified as a functional object (fun),
a tuple <strong>{external,Â Fun}</strong>, or an integer:<ul><li> <p>If SetFun is specified as a fun, the fun is applied to each element
of the given set and the return value is assumed to be a set.</p> </li><li> <p>If SetFun is specified as a tuple <strong>{external, Fun}</strong>, Fun is
applied to the external set of each element of the given set and the
return value is assumed to be an external set. Selecting the
elements of an unordered set as external sets and assembling a
new unordered set from a list of external sets is in the present
implementation more efficient than modifying each element as a
set. However, this optimization can only be used when the
elements of the unordered set are atomic or ordered sets. It
must also be the case that the type of the elements matches some
clause of Fun (the type of the created set is the result of
applying Fun to the type of the given set), and that Fun does
nothing but selecting, duplicating, or rearranging parts of the
elements.</p> </li><li> <p>Specifying a SetFun as an integer I is equivalent to
specifying <strong>{external, fun(X)Â -&gt; element(I,Â X)Â end}</strong>, but is to be preferred, as it
makes it possible to handle this case even more efficiently.</p> </li></ul>Examples of SetFuns:<pre>
fun sofs:union/1
fun(S) -&gt; sofs:partition(1, S) end
{external, fun(A) -&gt; A end}
{external, fun({A,_,C}) -&gt; {C,A} end}
{external, fun({_,{_,C}}) -&gt; C end}
{external, fun({_,{_,{_,E}=C}}) -&gt; {E,{E,C}} end}
2</pre>The order in which a SetFun is applied to the elements of an
unordered set is not specified, and can change in future
versions of this module.The execution time of the functions of this module is dominated
by the time it takes to sort lists. When no sorting is needed,
the execution time is in the worst case proportional to the sum
of the sizes of the input arguments and the returned value. A
few functions execute in constant time:

<a href="#to_external/1">to_external/1</a>
<a href="#type/1">type/1</a>.The functions of this module exit the process with a
<strong>badarg</strong>, <strong>bad_function</strong>, or <strong>type_mismatch</strong>
message when given badly formed arguments or sets the types of
which are not compatible.When comparing external sets, operator <strong>==/2</strong> is used.</p><h2>Data Types</h2><span class="name">anyset</span><p>Any kind of set (also included are the atomic sets).</p><span class="name">binary_relation</span><p>A <a href="#binary_relation">binary relation</a>.</p><span class="name">external_set</span><p>An <a href="#external_set">external set</a>.</p><span class="name">family</span><p>A <a href="#family">family</a> (of subsets).</p><span class="name">a_function</span><p>A <a href="#function">function</a>.</p><span class="name">ordset</span><p>An <a href="#sets_definition">ordered set</a>.</p><span class="name">relation</span><p>An <a href="#n_ary_relation">n-ary relation</a>.

binaries with UTF-8-encoded codepoints
(<em>UTF-8 binaries</em>), or a mix of the two.<pre><code class="">

                     but a binary with Latin-1-encoded codepoints
[&lt;&lt;"abc"&gt;&gt;, "..Ã¥Ã¤Ã¶"] is a valid string
[atom]               is NOT a valid string</code></pre>
This module operates on grapheme clusters. A <em>grapheme cluster</em>
is a user-perceived character, which can be represented by several
codepoints.
<pre><code class="">
"Ã¥"  [229] or [97, 778]
"eÌ"  [101, 778]</code></pre>
The string length of "ÃâeÌ" is 3, even though it is represented by the
codepoints <strong>[223,8593,101,778]</strong> or the UTF-8 binary
<strong>&lt;&lt;195,159,226,134,145,101,204,138&gt;&gt;</strong>.

Grapheme clusters for codepoints of class <strong>prepend</strong>
and non-modern (or decomposed) Hangul is not handled for performance
reasons in
<a href="#find/3">find/3</a>,
<a href="#replace/3">replace/3</a>,
<a href="#split/2">split/2</a>,
<a href="#lexemes/2">lexemes/2</a> and
<a href="#trim/3">trim/3</a>.

Splitting and appending strings is to be done on grapheme clusters
borders.
There is no verification that the results of appending strings are
valid or normalized.

Most of the functions expect all input to be normalized to one form,
see for example <a href="./unicode#characters_to_nfc_list/1">unicode#characters_to_nfc_list/1</a>.

Language or locale specific handling of input is not considered
in any function.

The functions can crash for non-valid input strings. For example,
the functions expect UTF-8 binaries but not all functions
verify that all binaries are encoded correctly.

Unless otherwise specified the return value type is the same as
the input type. That is, binary input returns binary output,
list input returns a list output, and mixed input can return a
mixed output.<pre><code class="">

4</code></pre><h3>Notes</h3><p>Some of the general string functions can seem to overlap each
other. The reason is that this string package is the
combination of two earlier packages and all functions of
both packages have been retained.</p><h2>supervisor</h2><p>Generic supervisor behavior.</p><p>This behavior module provides a supervisor, a process that
supervises other processes called child processes. A child
process can either be another supervisor or a worker process.
Worker processes are normally implemented using one of the
<a href="gen_event">gen_event</a>,
<a href="gen_server">gen_server</a>, or
<a href="gen_statem">gen_statem</a>
behaviors. A supervisor implemented using this module has
a standard set of interface functions and include functionality
for tracing and error reporting. Supervisors are used to build a
hierarchical process structure called a supervision tree, a
nice way to structure a fault-tolerant application. For more
information, see <a href="./sup_princ"> Supervisor Behaviour</a> in OTP Design Principles.A supervisor expects the definition of which child processes to
supervise to be specified in a callback module exporting a
predefined set of functions.Unless otherwise stated, all functions in this module fail
if the specified supervisor does not exist or if bad arguments
are specified.</p><a name="supervision_princ"></a><h3>Supervision Principles</h3><p>The supervisor is responsible for starting, stopping, and
monitoring its child processes. The basic idea of a supervisor is
that it must keep its child processes alive by restarting them
when necessary.</p><p>The children of a supervisor are defined as a list of
<em>child specifications</em>. When the supervisor is started, the child
processes are started in order from left to right according to
this list. When the supervisor terminates, it first terminates
its child processes in reversed start order, from right to left.</p><a name="sup_flags"></a><p>The supervisor properties are defined by the supervisor flags.
The type definition for the supervisor flags is as follows:</p><pre>
sup_flags() = #{strategy =&gt; strategy(),         % optional
                intensity =&gt; non_neg_integer(), % optional
                period =&gt; pos_integer()}        % optional</pre><p>A supervisor can have one of the following <em>restart strategies</em>
specified with the <strong>strategy</strong> key in the above map:</p><ul><li> <p><strong>one_for_one</strong> - If one child process terminates and
is to be restarted, only that child process is
affected. This is the default restart strategy.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>one_for_all</strong> - If one child process terminates and
is to be restarted, all other child processes are terminated
and then all child processes are restarted.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>rest_for_one</strong> - If one child process terminates and
is to be restarted, the 'rest' of the child processes (that
is, the child processes after the terminated child process
in the start order) are terminated. Then the terminated
child process and all child processes after it are restarted.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>simple_one_for_one</strong> - A simplified <strong>one_for_one</strong>
supervisor, where all child processes are dynamically added
instances of the same process type, that is, running the same
code.</p> <p>Functions
<a href="#delete_child/2">delete_child/2</a> and
<a href="#restart_child/2">restart_child/2</a>
are invalid for <strong>simple_one_for_one</strong> supervisors and return
<strong>{error,simple_one_for_one}</strong> if the specified supervisor
uses this restart strategy.</p> <p>Function <a href="#terminate_child/2">terminate_child/2</a> can be used for
children under <strong>simple_one_for_one</strong> supervisors by
specifying the child's <strong>pid()</strong> as the second argument. If
instead the child specification identifier is used,
<strong>terminate_child/2</strong> return
<strong>{error,simple_one_for_one}</strong>.</p> <p>As a <strong>simple_one_for_one</strong> supervisor can have
many children, it shuts them all down asynchronously. This
means that the children do their cleanup in parallel,
and therefore the order in which they are stopped is not
defined.</p> </li></ul><p>To prevent a supervisor from getting into an infinite loop of
child process terminations and restarts, a <em>maximum restart intensity</em> is defined using two integer values specified
with keys <strong>intensity</strong> and <strong>period</strong> in the above
map. Assuming the values <strong>MaxR</strong> for <strong>intensity</strong>
and <strong>MaxT</strong> for <strong>period</strong>, then, if more than <strong>MaxR</strong>
restarts occur within <strong>MaxT</strong> seconds, the supervisor
terminates all child processes and then itself. The termination
reason for the supervisor itself in that case will be <strong>shutdown</strong>.
<strong>intensity</strong> defaults to <strong>1</strong> and <strong>period</strong> defaults to
<strong>5</strong>.</p><a name="child_spec"></a><p>The type definition of a child specification is as follows:</p><pre>
child_spec() = #{id =&gt; child_id(),       % mandatory
                 start =&gt; mfargs(),      % mandatory
                 restart =&gt; restart(),   % optional

                 type =&gt; worker(),       % optional
                 modules =&gt; modules()}   % optional</pre><p>The old tuple format is kept for backwards compatibility,
see <a href="#type-child_spec">child_spec()</a>,
but the map is preferred.</p><ul><li> <p><strong>id</strong> is used to identify the child
specification internally by the supervisor.</p> <p>The <strong>id</strong> key is mandatory.</p> <p>Notice that this identifier on occations has been called
"name". As far as possible, the terms "identifier" or "id"
are now used but to keep backward compatibility,
some occurences of "name" can still be found, for example
in error messages.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>start</strong> defines the function call used to start the
child process. It must be a module-function-arguments
tuple <strong>{M,F,A}</strong> used as <strong>apply(M,F,A)</strong>.</p> <p>The start function <em>must create and link to</em> the child
process, and must return <strong>{ok,Child}</strong> or
<strong>{ok,Child,Info}</strong>, where <strong>Child</strong> is the pid of
the child process and <strong>Info</strong> any term that is
ignored by the supervisor.</p> <p>The start function can also return <strong>ignore</strong> if the child
process for some reason cannot be started, in which case
the child specification is kept by the supervisor
(unless it is a temporary child) but the non-existing child
process is ignored.</p> <p>If something goes wrong, the function can also return an
error tuple <strong>{error,Error}</strong>.</p> <p>Notice that the <strong>start_link</strong> functions of the different
behavior modules fulfill the above requirements.</p> <p>The <strong>start</strong> key is mandatory.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>restart</strong> defines when a terminated child process
must be restarted. A <strong>permanent</strong> child process is
always restarted. A <strong>temporary</strong> child process is
never restarted (even when the supervisor's restart strategy
is <strong>rest_for_one</strong> or <strong>one_for_all</strong> and a sibling's
death causes the temporary process to be terminated).
A <strong>transient</strong> child process is restarted only if
it terminates abnormally, that is, with another exit reason
than <strong>normal</strong>, <strong>shutdown</strong>, or <strong>{shutdown,Term}</strong>.</p> <p>The <strong>restart</strong> key is optional. If it is not specified,
it defaults to <strong>permanent</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>shutdown</strong> defines how a child process must be
terminated. <strong>brutal_kill</strong> means that the child process
is unconditionally terminated using <strong>exit(Child,kill)</strong>.
An integer time-out value means that the supervisor tells
the child process to terminate by calling
<strong>exit(Child,shutdown)</strong> and then wait for an exit signal
with reason <strong>shutdown</strong> back from the child process. If no
exit signal is received within the specified number of milliseconds,
the child process is unconditionally terminated using
<strong>exit(Child,kill)</strong>.</p> <p>If the child process is another supervisor, the shutdown time
must be set to <strong>infinity</strong> to give the subtree ample
time to shut down.</p> <div class="alert alert-warning"><h4 class="alert-heading">Warning</h4><p>Setting the shutdown time to anything other
than <strong>infinity</strong> for a child of type <strong>supervisor</strong>
can cause a race condition where the child in question
unlinks its own children, but fails to terminate them
before it is killed.</p></div> <p>It is also allowed to set it to <strong>infinity</strong>,
if the child process is a worker.</p> <div class="alert alert-warning"><h4 class="alert-heading">Warning</h4><p>Be careful when setting the shutdown time to
<strong>infinity</strong> when the child process is a worker. Because, in this
situation, the termination of the supervision tree depends on the
child process, it must be implemented in a safe way and its cleanup
procedure must always return.</p></div> <p>Notice that all child processes implemented using the standard
OTP behavior modules automatically adhere to the shutdown
protocol.</p> <p>The <strong>shutdown</strong> key is optional. If it is not specified,
it defaults to <strong>5000</strong> if the child is
of type <strong>worker</strong> and it defaults to <strong>infinity</strong> if
the child is of type <strong>supervisor</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>type</strong> specifies if the child process is a supervisor or
a worker.</p> <p>The <strong>type</strong> key is optional. If it is not specified,
it defaults to <strong>worker</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>modules</strong> is used by the release handler during code
replacement to determine which processes are using a certain
module. As a rule of thumb, if the child process is a
<strong>supervisor</strong>, <strong>gen_server</strong> or,
<strong>gen_statem</strong>,
this is to be a list with one element <strong>[Module]</strong>,
where <strong>Module</strong> is the callback module. If the child
process is an event manager (<strong>gen_event</strong>) with a
dynamic set of callback modules, value <strong>dynamic</strong>
must be used. For more information about release handling, see
<a href="./release_handling"> Release Handling</a>
in OTP Design Principles.</p> <p>The <strong>modules</strong> key is optional. If it is not specified, it
defaults to <strong>[M]</strong>, where <strong>M</strong> comes from the
child's start <strong>{M,F,A}</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p>Internally, the supervisor also keeps track of the pid

its own supervisor, but has a different interface than a real
supervisor to the subsystem. For more information, see

A supervisor bridge assumes the functions for starting and stopping
the subsystem to be located in a callback module exporting a

respond to a request. If the process does not respond, the
function evaluates <strong>exit({timeout, {M, F, A}})</strong>.
<a name="dbg_opt"></a>The functions make references to a debug structure.
The debug structure is a list of <strong>dbg_opt()</strong>, which is an internal
data type used by function <a href="#handle_system_msg/6">handle_system_msg/6</a>. No debugging is performed if it is 
an empty list.</p><h3>System Messages</h3><p>Processes that are not implemented as one of the standard
behaviors must still understand system messages. The following 
three messages must be understood:</p><ul><li> <p>Plain system messages. These are received as
<strong>{system, From, Msg}</strong>. The content and meaning of
this message are not interpreted by the
receiving process module. When a system message is received, function 
<a href="#handle_system_msg/6">handle_system_msg/6</a>
is called to handle the request.</p> </li><li> <p>Shutdown messages. If the process traps exits, it must
be able to handle a shutdown request from its parent, the
supervisor. The message <strong>{'EXIT', Parent, Reason}</strong>
from the parent is an order to terminate. The process must 
terminate when this message is received, normally with the
same <strong>Reason</strong> as <strong>Parent</strong>.
</p> </li><li> <p>If the modules used to implement the process change dynamically
during runtime, the process must understand one more message. An
example is the <a href="gen_event">gen_event</a>
processes. The message is <strong>{_Label, {From, Ref}, get_modules}</strong>.
The reply to this message is <strong>From ! {Ref, Modules}</strong>, where
<strong>Modules</strong> is a list of the currently active modules in the
process.</p> <p>This message is used by the release handler to find which
processes that execute a certain module. The process can later be
suspended and ordered to perform a code change for one of its
modules.</p> </li></ul><h3>System Events</h3><p>When debugging a process with the functions of this
module, the process generates <em>system_events</em>, which are
then treated in the debug function. For example, <strong>trace</strong>
formats the system events to the terminal.
</p><p>Four predefined system events are used when a
process receives or sends a message. The process can also define its
own system events. It is always up to the process itself
to format these events.</p><h2>Data Types</h2><span class="name">name</span><span class="name">system_event</span><dl><dt><strong>{in,<span class="anno">Msg</span>}</strong></dt><dd> <p>

representations. It converts between ISO Latin-1 characters and Unicode
characters, but it can also convert between different Unicode encodings
(like UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32).The default Unicode encoding in Erlang is in binaries UTF-8, which is also
the format in which built-in functions and libraries in OTP expect to find
binary Unicode data. In lists, Unicode data is encoded as integers, each
integer representing one character and encoded simply as the Unicode code
point for the character.Other Unicode encodings than integers representing code points or UTF-8
in binaries are referred to as "external encodings". The ISO
Latin-1 encoding
is in binaries and lists referred to as latin1-encoding.It is recommended to only use external encodings for communication with
external entities where this is required. When working inside the
Erlang/OTP environment, it is recommended to keep binaries in UTF-8 when
representing Unicode characters. ISO Latin-1 encoding is supported both
for backward compatibility and for communication
with external entities not supporting Unicode character sets.Programs should always operate on a normalized form and compare
canonical-equivalent Unicode characters as equal. All characters
should thus be normalized to one form once on the system borders.
One of the following functions can convert characters to their
normalized forms <a href="#characters_to_nfc_list/1">characters_to_nfc_list/1</a>,
<a href="#characters_to_nfc_binary/1">characters_to_nfc_binary/1</a>,
<a href="#characters_to_nfd_list/1">characters_to_nfd_list/1</a> or
<a href="#characters_to_nfd_binary/1">characters_to_nfd_binary/1</a>.
For general text
<a href="#characters_to_nfc_list/1">characters_to_nfc_list/1</a> or
<a href="#characters_to_nfc_binary/1">characters_to_nfc_binary/1</a> is preferred, and
for identifiers one of the compatibility normalization
functions, such as
<a href="#characters_to_nfkc_list/1">characters_to_nfkc_list/1</a>,
is preferred for security reasons.
The normalization functions where introduced in OTP 20.
Additional information on normalization can be found in the
<a href="http://unicode.org/faq/normalization.html">Unicode FAQ</a>.

binaries into a list of integers representing Unicode
characters. The binaries in the input can have characters
encoded as one of the following:</p><ul><li> <p>ISO Latin-1 (0-255, one character per byte). Here,
case parameter <strong><span class="anno">InEncoding</span></strong> is to be specified
as <strong>latin1</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p>One of the UTF-encodings, which is specified as parameter 
<strong><span class="anno">InEncoding</span></strong>.</p> </li></ul><p>
Note that integers in the list always represent code points
regardless of <strong><span class="anno">InEncoding</span></strong> passed. If
<strong><span class="anno">InEncoding</span> latin1</strong> is passed, only code
points &lt; 256 are allowed; otherwise, all valid unicode code
points are allowed.
</p><p>If <strong><span class="anno">InEncoding</span></strong> is <strong>latin1</strong>, parameter
<strong><span class="anno">Data</span></strong> corresponds to the <strong>iodata()</strong> type,
but for <strong>unicode</strong>, parameter <strong><span class="anno">Data</span></strong> can
contain integers &gt; 255
(Unicode characters beyond the ISO Latin-1 range), which
makes it invalid as <strong>iodata()</strong>.</p><p>The purpose of the function is mainly to convert
combinations of Unicode characters into a pure Unicode
string in list representation for further processing. For
writing the data to an external entity, the reverse function
<a href="#characters_to_binary/3">characters_to_binary/3</a>
comes in handy.</p><p>Option <strong>unicode</strong> is an alias for <strong>utf8</strong>, as this is the
preferred encoding for Unicode characters in
binaries. <strong>utf16</strong> is an alias for <strong>{utf16,big}</strong> and
<strong>utf32</strong> is an alias for <strong>{utf32,big}</strong>. The atoms <strong>big</strong>
and <strong>little</strong> denote big- or little-endian encoding.</p><p>If the data cannot be converted, either
because of illegal Unicode/ISO Latin-1 characters in the list, 
or because of invalid UTF encoding in any binaries, an error
tuple is returned. The error tuple contains the tag
<strong>error</strong>, a list representing the characters that could be
converted before the error occurred and a representation of the
characters including and after the offending integer/bytes. The
last part is mostly for debugging, as it still constitutes a
possibly deep or mixed list, or both, not necessarily of the same
depth as the original data. The error occurs when traversing the
list and whatever is left to decode is returned "as is".</p><p>However, if the input <strong><span class="anno">Data</span></strong> is a pure binary,
the third part of the error tuple is guaranteed to be a binary as
well.</p><p>Errors occur for the following reasons:</p><ul><li> <p>Integers out of range.</p> <p>If <strong><span class="anno">InEncoding</span></strong> is <strong>latin1</strong>, 
an error occurs whenever an integer &gt; 255 is found
in the lists.</p> <p>If <strong><span class="anno">InEncoding</span></strong> is of a Unicode type,
an error occurs whenever either of the following is found:</p> <ul><li> <p>An integer &gt; 16#10FFFF
(the maximum Unicode character)</p> </li><li> <p>An integer in the range 16#D800 to 16#DFFF (invalid range
reserved for UTF-16 surrogate pairs)</p> </li></ul> </li><li> <p>Incorrect UTF encoding.</p> <p>If <strong><span class="anno">InEncoding</span></strong> is one of the UTF types,
the bytes in any binaries must be valid in that encoding.</p> <p>Errors can occur for various reasons, including the
following:</p> <ul><li> <p>"Pure" decoding errors 
(like the upper bits of the bytes being wrong).</p> </li><li> <p>The bytes are decoded to a too large number.</p> </li><li> <p>The bytes are decoded to a code point in the invalid
Unicode range.</p> </li><li> <p>Encoding is "overlong", meaning that a number
should have been encoded in fewer bytes.</p> </li></ul> <p>The case of a truncated UTF is handled specially, see the
paragraph about incomplete binaries below.</p> <p>If <strong><span class="anno">InEncoding</span></strong> is <strong>latin1</strong>, binaries are
always valid as long as they contain whole bytes,
as each byte falls into the valid ISO Latin-1 range.</p> </li></ul><p>A special type of error is when no actual invalid integers or
bytes are found, but a trailing <strong>binary()</strong> consists of too
few bytes to decode the last character. This error can occur
if bytes are read from a file in chunks or if binaries in other
ways are split on non-UTF character boundaries. An <strong>incomplete</strong>
tuple is then returned instead of the <strong>error</strong> tuple.
It consists of the same parts as the <strong>error</strong> tuple, but
the tag is <strong>incomplete</strong> instead of <strong>error</strong> and the
last element is always guaranteed to be a binary consisting of
the first part of a (so far) valid UTF character.</p><p>If one UTF character is split over two consecutive binaries in
the <strong><span class="anno">Data</span></strong>, the conversion succeeds. This means
that a character can be decoded from a range of binaries as long
as the whole range is specified as input without errors occurring.</p><p><em>Example:</em></p><pre><code class="">
decode_data(Data) -&gt;
   case unicode:characters_to_list(Data,unicode) of
      {incomplete,Encoded, Rest} -&gt;
            More = get_some_more_data(),
            Encoded ++ decode_data([Rest, More]);
      {error,Encoded,Rest} -&gt;
            handle_error(Encoded,Rest);
      List -&gt;
            List
   end.</code></pre><p>However, bit strings that are not whole bytes are not allowed,
so a UTF character must be split along 8-bit boundaries to
ever be decoded.</p><p>A <strong>badarg</strong> exception is thrown for the following cases:</p><ul><li>Any parameters are of the wrong type.</li><li>The list structure is invalid (a number as tail).</li><li>The binaries do not contain whole bytes (bit strings).</li></ul><h3>characters_to_nfc_list/1</h3><p>Normalize characters to a list of canonical equivalent composed Unicode characters.</p><p>Converts a possibly deep list of characters and binaries

	</pre><h2>win32reg</h2><p>Provides access to the registry on Windows.</p><p>This module provides read and write access to the
registry on Windows. It is essentially a port driver wrapped around the
Win32 API calls for accessing the registry.The registry is a hierarchical database, used to store various system
and software information in Windows.
It contains installation data, and is updated by installers
and system programs. The Erlang installer updates the registry by adding
data that Erlang needs.The registry contains keys and values. Keys are like the directories
in a file system, they form a hierarchy. Values are like files, they have
a name and a value, and also a type.Paths to keys are left to right, with subkeys to the right and backslash
between keys. (Remember that backslashes must be doubled in Erlang
strings.) Case is preserved but not significant.For example,
<strong>"\\hkey_local_machine\\software\\Ericsson\\Erlang\\5.0"</strong> is the key
for the installation data for the latest Erlang release.There are six entry points in the Windows registry, top-level keys.
They can be abbreviated in this module as follows:<pre>
Abbreviation     Registry key
============     ============
hkcr             HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
current_user     HKEY_CURRENT_USER
hkcu             HKEY_CURRENT_USER
local_machine    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
hklm             HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
users            HKEY_USERS
hku              HKEY_USERS
current_config   HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG
hkcc             HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG
dyn_data         HKEY_DYN_DATA
hkdd             HKEY_DYN_DATA</pre>The key above can be written as
<strong>"\\hklm\\software\\ericsson\\erlang\\5.0"</strong>.This module uses a current key. It works much like the
current directory. From the current key, values can be fetched, subkeys
can be listed, and so on.Under a key, any number of named values can be stored. They have names,
types, and data.<strong>win32reg</strong> supports storing of the following types:<ul><li><strong>REG_DWORD</strong>, which is an integer</li><li><strong>REG_SZ</strong>, which is a string</li><li><strong>REG_BINARY</strong>, which is a binary</li></ul>Other types can be read, and are returned as binaries.There is also a "default" value, which has the empty string as name. It
is read and written with the atom <strong>default</strong> instead of the name.Some registry values are stored as strings with references to environment
variables, for example, <strong>%SystemRoot%Windows</strong>. <strong>SystemRoot</strong> is
an environment variable, and is to be replaced with its value. Function
<a href="#expand/1">expand/1</a> is provided so that
environment variables surrounded by <strong>%</strong> can be expanded to their
values.For more information on the Windows registry, see consult the Win32

invalid (for example, if the key has been removed).</p><h3>delete_key/1</h3><p>Delete the current key.</p><p>Deletes the current key, if it is valid. Calls the Win32 API
function <strong>RegDeleteKey()</strong>. Notice that this call does not change
the current key (unlike
<a href="#change_key_create/2">change_key_create/2</a>).
This means that after the call, the current key is invalid.</p><h3>delete_value/2</h3><p>Delete the named value on the current key.</p><p>Deletes a named value on the current key. The atom <strong>default</strong> is

characters. Anything between two <strong>%</strong> is taken for an environment
variable, and is replaced by the value. Two consecutive <strong>%</strong> are
replaced by one <strong>%</strong>.</p><p>A variable name that is not in the environment results in an
error.</p><h3>format_error/1</h3><p>Convert a POSIX error code to a string.</p><p>Converts a POSIX error code to a string
(by calling <strong>erl_posix_msg:message/1</strong>).</p><h3>open/1</h3><p>Open the registry for reading or writing.</p><p>Opens the registry for reading or writing. The current key is the

described in the "Appnote.txt" file. However, files are
stored without compression if they are already compressed.
<strong>zip/2</strong> and <strong>zip/3</strong> check the file extension
to determine if the file is to be stored without compression.
Files with the following extensions are not compressed:
<strong>.Z</strong>, <strong>.zip</strong>, <strong>.zoo</strong>, <strong>.arc</strong>, <strong>.lzh</strong>,
<strong>.arj</strong>.</p><p>It is possible to override the default behavior and control
what types of files that are to be compressed by using options

many <strong>compress</strong> and <strong>uncompress</strong> options.</p><p>To trigger file compression, its extension must match with the
<strong>compress</strong> condition and must not match the
<strong>uncompress</strong> condition. For example, if <strong>compress</strong> is
set to <strong>["gif", "jpg"]</strong> and <strong>uncompress</strong> is set to
