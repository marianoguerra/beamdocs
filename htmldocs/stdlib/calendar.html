    conversions.</p><p>This module provides computation of local and universal time,
day of the week, and many time conversion functions.Time is local when it is adjusted in accordance with the current
time zone and daylight saving. Time is universal when it reflects
the time at longitude zero, without any adjustment for daylight
saving. Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) time is also called
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).The time functions <strong>local_time/0</strong> and
<strong>universal_time/0</strong> in this module both return date
and time. The is because separate functions for date
and time can result in a date/time combination that is displaced
by 24 hours. This occurs if one of the functions is called
before midnight, and the other after midnight. This problem also
applies to the Erlang BIFs <strong>date/0</strong> and <strong>time/0</strong>, and
their use is strongly discouraged if a reliable date/time stamp
is required.All dates conform to the Gregorian calendar. This calendar was
introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582 and was used in all
Catholic countries from this year. Protestant parts of Germany
and the Netherlands adopted it in 1698, England followed in 1752,
and Russia in 1918 (the October revolution of 1917 took place in
November according to the Gregorian calendar).The Gregorian calendar in this module is extended back to year 0.
For a given date, the <em>gregorian days</em> is the number of
days up to and including the date specified. Similarly,
the <em>gregorian seconds</em> for a specified date and time is
the number of seconds up to and including the specified date
and time.For computing differences between epochs in time, use
the functions counting gregorian days or seconds. If epochs are
specified as local time, they must be converted to universal time
to get the correct value of the elapsed time between epochs.
Use of function <strong>time_difference/2</strong> is discouraged.Different definitions exist for the week of the year.
This module contains a week of the year implementation
conforming to the ISO 8601 standard. As the week number for a
specified date can fall on the previous, the current, or on the next
year, it is important to specify both the year and the week number.
Functions <strong>iso_week_number/0</strong> and <strong>iso_week_number/1</strong>
return a tuple of the year and the week number.</p><h1>Data Types</h1><span class="name">datetime</span><span class="name">datetime1970</span><span class="name">date</span><span class="name">year</span><p>Year cannot be abbreviated. For example, 93 denotes year
