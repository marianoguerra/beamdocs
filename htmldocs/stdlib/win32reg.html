registry on Windows. It is essentially a port driver wrapped around the
Win32 API calls for accessing the registry.The registry is a hierarchical database, used to store various system
and software information in Windows.
It contains installation data, and is updated by installers
and system programs. The Erlang installer updates the registry by adding
data that Erlang needs.The registry contains keys and values. Keys are like the directories
in a file system, they form a hierarchy. Values are like files, they have
a name and a value, and also a type.Paths to keys are left to right, with subkeys to the right and backslash
between keys. (Remember that backslashes must be doubled in Erlang
strings.) Case is preserved but not significant.For example,
<strong>"\\hkey_local_machine\\software\\Ericsson\\Erlang\\5.0"</strong> is the key
for the installation data for the latest Erlang release.There are six entry points in the Windows registry, top-level keys.
They can be abbreviated in this module as follows:<pre>
Abbreviation     Registry key
============     ============
hkcr             HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
current_user     HKEY_CURRENT_USER
hkcu             HKEY_CURRENT_USER
local_machine    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
hklm             HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
users            HKEY_USERS
hku              HKEY_USERS
current_config   HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG
hkcc             HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG
dyn_data         HKEY_DYN_DATA
hkdd             HKEY_DYN_DATA</pre>The key above can be written as
<strong>"\\hklm\\software\\ericsson\\erlang\\5.0"</strong>.This module uses a current key. It works much like the
current directory. From the current key, values can be fetched, subkeys
can be listed, and so on.Under a key, any number of named values can be stored. They have names,
types, and data.<strong>win32reg</strong> supports storing of the following types:<ul><li><strong>REG_DWORD</strong>, which is an integer</li><li><strong>REG_SZ</strong>, which is a string</li><li><strong>REG_BINARY</strong>, which is a binary</li></ul>Other types can be read, and are returned as binaries.There is also a "default" value, which has the empty string as name. It
is read and written with the atom <strong>default</strong> instead of the name.Some registry values are stored as strings with references to environment
variables, for example, <strong>%SystemRoot%Windows</strong>. <strong>SystemRoot</strong> is
an environment variable, and is to be replaced with its value. Function
<a href="#expand/1">expand/1</a> is provided so that
environment variables surrounded by <strong>%</strong> can be expanded to their
values.For more information on the Windows registry, see consult the Win32
Programmer's Reference.</p><h1>Data Types</h1><span class="name">reg_handle</span><p>As returned by
<a href="#open/1">open/1</a>.</p><span class="name">name</span><span class="name">value</span><h1>Functions</h1><h2>change_key/2</h2><p>Move to a key in the registry.</p><p>Changes the current key to another key. Works like <strong>cd</strong>.
The key can be specified as a relative path or as an
absolute path, starting with <strong>\.</strong></p><h2>change_key_create/2</h2><p>Move to a key, create it if it is not there.</p><p>Creates a key, or just changes to it, if it is already there. Works
like a combination of <strong>mkdir</strong> and <strong>cd</strong>.
Calls the Win32 API function <strong>RegCreateKeyEx()</strong>.</p><p>The registry must have been opened in write mode.</p><h2>close/1</h2><p>Close the registry.</p><p>Closes the registry. After that, the <strong><span class="anno">RegHandle</span></strong>
cannot be used.</p><h2>current_key/1</h2><p>Return the path to the current key.</p><p>Returns the path to the current key. This is the equivalent of
<strong>pwd</strong>.</p><p>Notice that the current key is stored in the driver, and can be
invalid (for example, if the key has been removed).</p><h2>delete_key/1</h2><p>Delete the current key.</p><p>Deletes the current key, if it is valid. Calls the Win32 API
function <strong>RegDeleteKey()</strong>. Notice that this call does not change
the current key (unlike
<a href="#change_key_create/2">change_key_create/2</a>).
This means that after the call, the current key is invalid.</p><h2>delete_value/2</h2><p>Delete the named value on the current key.</p><p>Deletes a named value on the current key. The atom <strong>default</strong> is
used for the default value.</p><p>The registry must have been opened in write mode.</p><h2>expand/1</h2><p>Expand a string with environment variables.</p><p>Expands a string containing environment variables between percent
characters. Anything between two <strong>%</strong> is taken for an environment
variable, and is replaced by the value. Two consecutive <strong>%</strong> are
replaced by one <strong>%</strong>.</p><p>A variable name that is not in the environment results in an
error.</p><h2>format_error/1</h2><p>Convert a POSIX error code to a string.</p><p>Converts a POSIX error code to a string
(by calling <strong>erl_posix_msg:message/1</strong>).</p><h2>open/1</h2><p>Open the registry for reading or writing.</p><p>Opens the registry for reading or writing. The current key is the
root (<strong>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT</strong>). Flag <strong>read</strong> in the mode list
can be omitted.</p><p>Use <a href="#change_key/2">change_key/2</a>
with an absolute path after
<a href="#open/1">open/1</a>.</p><h2>set_value/3</h2><p>Set value at the current registry key with specified name. </p><p>Sets the named (or default) value to <strong>value</strong>. Calls the Win32
API function <strong>RegSetValueEx()</strong>. The value can be of three types,
and the corresponding registry type is used. The supported types
are the following:</p><ul><li><strong>REG_DWORD</strong> for integers</li><li><strong>REG_SZ</strong> for strings</li><li><strong>REG_BINARY</strong> for binaries</li></ul><p>Other types cannot be added or changed.</p><p>The registry must have been opened in write mode.</p><h2>sub_keys/1</h2><p>Get subkeys to the current key.</p><p>Returns a list of subkeys to the current key. Calls the Win32
API function <strong>EnumRegKeysEx()</strong>.</p><p>Avoid calling this on the root keys, as it can be slow.</p><h2>value/2</h2><p>Get the named value on the current key.</p><p>Retrieves the named value (or default) on the current key.
Registry values of type <strong>REG_SZ</strong> are returned as strings.
Type <strong>REG_DWORD</strong> values are returned as integers. All other
types are returned as binaries.</p><h2>values/1</h2><p>Get all values on the current key.</p><p>Retrieves a list of all values on the current key. The values
have types corresponding to the registry types, see
<a href="#value/2">value/2</a>.
Calls the Win32 API function <strong>EnumRegValuesEx()</strong>.</p><h2>See Also</h2><p><strong>erl_posix_msg</strong>,
