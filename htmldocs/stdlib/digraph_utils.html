directed graphs. For basic functions on directed graphs, see the
<a href="digraph">digraph</a> module.<ul><li> <p>A <a name="digraph"></a><em>directed graph</em> (or just
"digraph") is a pair (V,Â E) of a finite set V of
<a name="vertex"></a><em>vertices</em> and a finite set E of
<a name="edge"></a><em>directed edges</em> (or just "edges").
The set of edges E is a subset of VÂ ÃÂ V (the
Cartesian product of V with itself).</p> </li><li> <p>Digraphs can be annotated with more information. Such information
can be attached to the vertices and to the edges of the digraph. An
annotated digraph is called a <em>labeled digraph</em>, and the
information attached to a vertex or an edge is called a
<a name="label"></a><em>label</em>.</p> </li><li> <p>An edge eÂ =Â (v,Â w) is said to
<a name="emanate"></a><em>emanate</em> from vertex v and to
be <a name="incident"></a><em>incident</em> on vertex w.</p> </li><li> <p>If an edge is emanating from v and incident on w, then w is
said to be an <a name="out_neighbour"></a>
<em>out-neighbor</em> of v, and v is said to be an
<a name="in_neighbour"></a><em>in-neighbor</em> of w.</p> </li><li> <p>A <a name="path"></a><em>path</em> P from v[1] to v[k]
in a digraph (V,Â E) is a non-empty sequence
v[1],Â v[2],Â ...,Â v[k] of vertices in V such that
there is an edge (v[i],v[i+1]) in E for
1Â &lt;=Â iÂ &lt;Â k.</p> </li><li> <p>The <a name="length"></a><em>length</em> of path P is
k-1.</p> </li><li> <p>Path P is a <a name="cycle"></a><em>cycle</em> if the
length of P is not zero and v[1] = v[k].</p> </li><li> <p>A <a name="loop"></a><em>loop</em> is a cycle of length
one.</p> </li><li> <p>An <a name="acyclic_digraph"></a><em>acyclic digraph</em>
is a digraph without cycles.</p> </li><li> <p>A <a name="depth_first_traversal"></a><em>depth-first traversal</em> of a directed digraph can be viewed as a process
that visits all vertices of the digraph. Initially, all vertices
are marked as unvisited. The traversal starts with an
arbitrarily chosen vertex, which is marked as visited, and
follows an edge to an unmarked vertex, marking that vertex. The
search then proceeds from that vertex in the same fashion, until
there is no edge leading to an unvisited vertex. At that point
the process backtracks, and the traversal continues as long as
there are unexamined edges. If unvisited vertices remain
when all edges from the first vertex have been examined, some
so far unvisited vertex is chosen, and the process is repeated.</p> </li><li> <p>A <a name="partial_ordering"></a><em>partial ordering</em>
of a set S is a transitive, antisymmetric, and reflexive relation
between the objects of S.</p> </li><li> <p>The problem of
<a name="topsort"></a><em>topological sorting</em> is to find
a total ordering of S that is a superset of the partial ordering. A
digraph GÂ =Â (V,Â E) is equivalent to a relation E
on V (we neglect that the version of directed graphs
provided by the <strong>digraph</strong> module allows multiple edges
between vertices). If the digraph has no cycles of length two or
more, the reflexive and transitive closure of E is a
partial ordering.</p> </li><li> <p>A <a name="subgraph"></a><em>subgraph</em> G' of G is a
digraph whose vertices and edges form subsets of the vertices
and edges of G.</p> </li><li> <p>G' is <em>maximal</em> with respect to a property P if all other
subgraphs that include the vertices of G' do not have property P.</p> </li><li> <p>A <a name="strong_components"></a><em>strongly connected component</em> is a maximal subgraph such that there is a path
between each pair of vertices.</p> </li><li> <p>A <a name="components"></a><em>connected component</em>
is a maximal subgraph such that there is a path between each pair of
vertices, considering all edges undirected.</p> </li><li> <p>An <a name="arborescence"></a><em>arborescence</em> is an
acyclic digraph with a vertex V, the
<a name="root"></a><em>root</em>, such that there is a unique
path from V to every other vertex of G.</p> </li><li> <p>A <a name="tree"></a><em>tree</em> is an acyclic non-empty
digraph such that there is a unique path between every pair of
vertices, considering all edges undirected.</p> </li></ul></p><h1>Functions</h1><h2>arborescence_root/1</h2><p>Check if a digraph is an arborescence.</p><p>Returns <strong>{yes, <span class="anno">Root</span>}</strong> if <strong><span class="anno">Root</span></strong>

connected components, and vertices x and y exist in X
and Y, respectively, such that there is an
edge <a href="#emanate">emanating</a> from x

an edge emanating from X and incident on Y is created.</p><p>The created digraph has the same type as <strong><span class="anno">Digraph</span></strong>.
All vertices and edges have the
default <a href="#label">label</a> <strong>[]</strong>.</p><p>Each <a href="#cycle">cycle</a> is

The order is given by
a <a href="#depth_first_traversal">depth-first traversal</a> of the digraph, collecting visited
vertices in postorder. More precisely, the vertices visited
while searching from an arbitrarily chosen vertex are
collected in postorder, and all those collected vertices are
placed before the subsequently visited vertices.</p><h2>preorder/1</h2><p>Return the vertices of a digraph in preorder.</p><p>Returns all vertices of digraph <strong><span class="anno">Digraph</span></strong>.
The order is given by

vertices in preorder.</p><h2>reachable/2</h2><p>Return the vertices reachable from some vertices of a digraph. </p><p>Returns an unsorted list of digraph vertices such that for
each vertex in the list, there is a
<a href="#path">path</a> in <strong><span class="anno">Digraph</span></strong>
from some
vertex of <strong><span class="anno">Vertices</span></strong> to the vertex. In particular,
as paths can have length zero, the vertices of
<strong><span class="anno">Vertices</span></strong> are included in the returned list.</p><h2>reachable_neighbours/2</h2><p>Return the neighbors reachable from some vertices of a digraph.</p><p>Returns an unsorted list of digraph vertices such that for

<a href="#path">path</a> in <strong><span class="anno">Digraph</span></strong>
of length
one or more from some vertex of <strong><span class="anno">Vertices</span></strong> to the
vertex. As a consequence, only those vertices
of <strong><span class="anno">Vertices</span></strong> that are included in
some <a href="#cycle">cycle</a> are returned.</p><h2>reaching/2</h2><p>Return the vertices that reach some vertices of a digraph. </p><p>Returns an unsorted list of digraph vertices such that for
each vertex in the list, there is
a <a href="#path">path</a> from the vertex to some

each vertex in the list, there is

as vertices those vertices of <strong><span class="anno">Digraph</span></strong> that are
mentioned in <strong><span class="anno">Vertices</span></strong>.</p><p>If the value of option <strong>type</strong> is <strong>inherit</strong>, which is
the default, the type of <strong><span class="anno">Digraph</span></strong> is used
for the subgraph as well. Otherwise the option value of <strong>type</strong>
is used as argument to
<a href="./digraph#new/1">digraph#new/1</a>.</p><p>If the value of option <strong>keep_labels</strong> is <strong>true</strong>,
which is the default,
the <a href="#label">labels</a> of vertices and edges
of <strong><span class="anno">Digraph</span></strong> are used for the subgraph as well. If
the value is <strong>false</strong>, default label <strong>[]</strong> is used
for the vertices and edges of the subgroup.</p><p><strong>subgraph(<span class="anno">Digraph</span>, <span class="anno">Vertices</span>)</strong> is
equivalent to
