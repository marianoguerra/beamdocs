A bug in gen_statem has been fixed where the internal
timeout message could arrive as an info to the callback
module during high load due to incorrect use of
asynchronous timer cancel.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15295</p> </li></ul><h2>STDLIB 3.8.1</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>Fixed a performance regression when reading files
opened with the <strong>compressed</strong> flag.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15706 Aux Id: ERIERL-336 </p> </li></ul><h2>STDLIB 3.8</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p> Fix a bug in the Erlang Pretty Printer: long atom
names in combination with <strong>&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;</strong> could
cause a crash. </p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15592 Aux Id: ERL-818 </p> </li><li> <p> Fix bugs that could cause wrong results or bad
performance when formatting lists of characters using the
control sequences <strong>p</strong> or <strong>P</strong> and limiting the
output with the option <strong>chars_limit</strong>. </p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15639</p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>
Improved ETS documentation about safe table traversal and
the partially bound key optimization for
<strong>ordered_set</strong>.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15545 Aux Id: PR-2103, PR-2139 </p> </li><li> <p> Optimize <strong>calendar:gregorian_days_to_date/1</strong>.
</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15572 Aux Id: PR-2121 </p> </li><li> <p> Optimize functions
<strong>calendar:rfc3339_to_system_time()</strong> and
<strong>calendar:system_time_to_rfc3339()</strong>. </p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15630</p> </li></ul><h2>STDLIB 3.7.1</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p> Optimize pretty printing of terms. The slower
behaviour was introduced in Erlang/OTP 20. </p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15573 Aux Id: ERIERL-306 </p> </li></ul><h2>STDLIB 3.7</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
Document <strong>bit_size</strong> in match specifications and
allow it in <strong>ets:fun2ms</strong>.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15343 Aux Id: PR-1962 </p> </li><li> <p>The <strong>beam()</strong> type in <strong>beam_lib</strong> is defined
as <strong>module() | file:filename() | binary()</strong>. The
<strong>module()</strong> is misleading. Giving the module name as
an atom will only work if the BEAM file is in a current
directory.</p> <p>To avoid confusion, <strong>module()</strong> has been removed
from the type. That means that there will be a Dialyzer
warning for code that call <strong>beam_lib</strong> with an atom
as filename, but the calls will still work.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15378 Aux Id: ERL-696 </p> </li><li> <p>
<strong>unicode_util</strong> crashed on certain emoji grapheme
clusters in binary strings.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15428 Aux Id: ERL-777 </p> </li><li> <p>When an external fun was used, warnings for unused
variables could be suppressed.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15437 Aux Id: ERL-762 </p> </li><li> <p>
Fix reduction count in lists:member/2</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15474 Aux Id: ERIERL-229 </p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>When specified, the <strong>+{source,Name}</strong> option will
now override the actual file name in stack traces,
instead of only affecting the return value of
<strong>Mod:module_info()</strong>.</p> <p>The <strong>+deterministic</strong> flag will also affect stack
traces now, omitting all path information except the file
name, fixing a long-standing issue where deterministic
builds required deterministic paths.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15245 Aux Id: ERL-706 </p> </li><li> <p>List subtraction (The <strong>--</strong> operator) will now
yield properly on large inputs.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15371</p> </li><li> <p>
<strong>calendar:system_time_to_rfc3339/1,2</strong> no longer
remove trailing zeros from fractions.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15464</p> </li></ul><h2>STDLIB 3.6</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>The specs of <strong>filename:basedir/2,3</strong> are
corrected.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15252 Aux Id: ERL-667 </p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p> Let <strong>dets:open_file()</strong> exit with a <strong>badarg</strong>
message if given a raw file name (a binary). </p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15253 Aux Id: OTP-13229, ERL-55 </p> </li><li> <p> The <strong>Format</strong> argument of the formatting
functions in modules <strong>io</strong> and <strong>io_lib</strong> is
accepted even if it is, for example, a list of binaries.
This is how it used to be before Erlang/OTP 21.0. </p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15304</p> </li></ul><h2>STDLIB 3.5.1</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p> Fix a bug that could cause a crash when formatting a
list of non-characters using the control sequences
<strong>p</strong> or <strong>P</strong> and limiting the output with the
option <strong>chars_limit</strong>. </p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15159</p> </li></ul><h2>STDLIB 3.5</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p><strong>gen_statem</strong> improvements.</p> <p> When using an
exception that is valid but not allowed in a state enter
call, the reason has been changed from
<strong>{bad_action_from_state_function,Action}</strong> to
<strong>{bad_state_enter_action_from_state_function,Action}</strong>.
</p><p> Timer parsing has been improved. Many erroneous
timeout tuples was not handled correctly. </p><p> The
documentation has been updated, in particular the User's
Guide and the pointer to it from the Reference Manual is
much more obvious. </p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14015</p> </li><li> <p>
The type specifications for <strong>file:posix/0</strong> and
<strong>inet:posix/0</strong> have been updated according to which
errors file and socket operations should be able to
return.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14019 Aux Id: ERL-550 </p> </li><li> <p> File operations used to accept <a href="../kernel/file#type-name_all">filenames</a>
containing null characters (integer value zero). This
caused the name to be truncated and in some cases
arguments to primitive operations to be mixed up.
Filenames containing null characters inside the filename
are now <em>rejected</em> and will cause primitive file
operations to fail. </p> <p> Also environment variable
operations used to accept <a href="../kernel/os#type-env_var_name">names</a> and
<a href="../kernel/os#type-env_var_value">values</a> of
environment variables containing null characters (integer
value zero). This caused operations to silently produce
erroneous results. Environment variable names and values
containing null characters inside the name or value are
now <em>rejected</em> and will cause environment variable
operations to fail. </p> <p>Primitive environment
variable operations also used to accept the <strong>$=</strong>
character in environment variable names causing various
problems. <strong>$=</strong> characters in environment variable
names are now also <em>rejected</em>. </p> <p>Also
<a href="../kernel/os#cmd/1">kernel/os#cmd/1</a> now
reject null characters inside its <a href="../kernel/os#type-os_command">command</a>.
</p> <p><a href="../erts/erlang#open_port/2">erts/erlang#open_port/2</a>
will also reject null characters inside the port name
from now on.</p> <p>
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14543 Aux Id: ERL-370 </p> </li><li> <p> Make <strong>io_lib:unscan_format/1</strong> work with pad char
and default precision. </p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14958 Aux Id: PR-1735 </p> </li><li> <p> The control sequence modifiers <strong>t</strong> and <strong>l</strong>
can be used together in the same control sequence which
makes it possible to have Unicode atoms and no detection
of printable character lists at the same time. </p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14971 Aux Id: PR-1743 </p> </li><li> <p> Fix a bug in the Erlang code linter: the check of
guard expressions no longer returns <strong>false</strong> if the
map syntax is used. The bug affected the Erlang shell,
the Debugger, and other modules evaluating abstract code.
</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15035 Aux Id: ERL-613 </p> </li><li> <p>
A sys debug fun of type {Fun,State} should not be
possible to install twice. This was, however, possible if
the current State was 'undefined', which was mistaken for
non-existing fun. This has been corrected.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15049</p> </li><li> <p>
Fix <strong>io:putchars/2</strong> stacktrace rewriting at errors
to point to a valid function.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15101</p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>
The <strong>gen_server</strong> has gotten a new callback
<strong>handle_continue/2</strong> for check pointing the state.
This is useful at least when implementing behaviours on
top of <strong>gen_server</strong> and for some start up scenarios.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-13019 Aux Id: PR-1490 </p> </li><li> <p> The semantics of timeout parameter
<strong>{clean_timeout,infinity}</strong> to
<strong>gen_statem:call/3</strong> has been changed to use a proxy
process for the call. With this change
<strong>clean_timeout</strong> implicates a proxy process with no
exceptions. This may be a hard to observe
incompatibility: in the presence of network problems a
late reply could arrive in the caller's message queue
when catching errors. That will not happen after this
correction. </p><p> The semantics of timeout parameter
<strong>infinity</strong> has not been changed. </p> <p>
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-13073 Aux Id: PR-1595 </p> </li><li> <p>A new logging API is added to Erlang/OTP, see the
<a href="./logger">kernel/logger</a> manual
page, and section <a href="./logger_chapter">Logging</a> in the
Kernel User's Guide.</p> <p>Calls to <strong>error_logger</strong> are automatically
redirected to the new API, and legacy error logger event
handlers can still be used. It is, however, recommended
to use the Logger API directly when writing new code.</p> <p>Notice the following potential incompatibilities:</p> <ul><li><p>Kernel configuration parameters
<strong>error_logger</strong> still works, but is overruled if the
default handler's output destination is configured with
Kernel configuration parameter <strong>logger</strong>.</p> <p>In
general, parameters for configuring error logger are
overwritten by new parameters for configuring
Logger.</p></li><li><p>The concept of SASL error
logging is deprecated, meaning that by default the SASL
application does not affect which log events are
logged.</p> <p>By default, supervisor reports and crash
reports are logged by the default Logger handler started
by Kernel, and end up at the same destination (terminal
or file) as other standard log event from Erlang/OTP.</p> <p>Progress reports are not logged by default, but can be
enabled by setting the primary log level to info, for
example with the Kernel configuration parameter
<strong>logger_level</strong>.</p> <p>To obtain backwards
compatibility with the SASL error logging functionality
from earlier releases, set Kernel configuration parameter
<strong>logger_sasl_compatible</strong> to <strong>true</strong>. This
prevents the default Logger handler from logging any
supervisor-, crash-, or progress reports. Instead, SASL
adds a separate Logger handler during application start,
which takes care of these log events. The SASL
configuration parameters <strong>sasl_error_logger</strong> and
<strong>sasl_errlog_type</strong> specify the destination (terminal
or file) and severity level to log for these
events.</p></li></ul> <p>
Since Logger is new in Erlang/OTP 21.0, we do reserve the
right to introduce changes to the Logger API and
functionality in patches following this release. These
changes might or might not be backwards compatible with
the initial version.</p> <p>
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-13295</p> </li><li> <p> Add functions
<strong>calendar:system_time_to_local_time/2</strong> and
<strong>calendar:system_time_to_universal_time/2</strong>. </p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-13413</p> </li><li> <p> Functions <strong>rand:uniform_real/0</strong> and
<strong>rand:uniform_real_s/1</strong> have been added. They
produce uniformly distributed numbers in the range <strong>0.0 =&lt; X &lt; 1.0</strong> that are as close to random real
numbers as Normalized IEEE 754 Double Precision allows.
Because the random real number exactly <strong>0.0</strong> is
infinitely improbable they will never return exactly
<strong>0.0</strong>. </p><p> These properties are useful when you
need to call for example <strong>math:log(X)</strong> or <strong>1 / X</strong> on a random value <strong>X</strong>, since that will never
fail with a number from these new functions. </p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-13764 Aux Id: PR-1574 </p> </li><li> <p>
Added maps:iterator/0 and maps:next/1 to be used for
iterating over the key-value associations in a map.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14012</p> </li><li> <p>Changed the default behaviour of <strong>.erlang</strong>
loading: <strong>.erlang</strong> is no longer loaded from the
current directory. <strong>c:erlangrc(PathList)</strong> can be
used to search and load an <strong>.erlang</strong> file from user
specified directories.</p> <p><strong>escript</strong>,
<strong>erlc</strong>, <strong>dialyzer</strong> and <strong>typer</strong> no longer
load an <strong>.erlang</strong> at all.</p> <p>
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14439</p> </li><li> <p>
Added new uri_string module to stdlib for handling URIs
(RFC 3986).</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14496</p> </li><li> <p>
Update Unicode specification to version 10.0.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14503</p> </li><li> <p><strong>filelib:wildcard()</strong> now allows characters with a
special meaning to be escaped using backslashes.</p> <p>This is an incompatible change, but note that the use
of backslashes in wildcards would already work
differently on Windows and Unix. Existing calls to
<strong>filelib:wildcard()</strong> needs to be updated. On
Windows, directory separators must always be written as a
slash.</p> <p>
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14577</p> </li><li> <p>
The supervisor now stores its child specifications in a
map instead of a list. This causes a significant
improvement when starting many children under a
non-simple_one_for_one supervisor.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14586</p> </li><li> <p> The <strong>base64</strong> module is optimized. </p> <p> Note
that the functions <strong>encode/1</strong>, <strong>decode/1</strong>, and
<strong>mime_decode/1</strong> fail unless called with an argument
of the documented type. They used to accept any
<strong>iodata()</strong>. </p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14624 Aux Id: PR-1565 </p> </li><li> <p> Add function <strong>lists:search/2</strong>. </p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14675 Aux Id: PR-102 </p> </li><li> <p>
uri_string module extended with functions for handling
application/x-www-form-urlencoded query strings based on
the HTML5 specification.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14747</p> </li><li> <p> Add functions
<strong>calendar:rfc3339_to_system_time/1,2</strong> and
<strong>calendar:system_time_to_rfc3339/1,2</strong>. </p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14764</p> </li><li> <p> The stack traces returned by the functions of the
<strong>erl_eval</strong> module more accurately reflect where the
exception occurred. </p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14826 Aux Id: PR 1540 </p> </li><li> <p> Add options <strong>atime</strong>, <strong>mtime</strong>, <strong>ctime</strong>,
<strong>uid</strong>, and <strong>gid</strong> to the <strong>erl_tar:add/3,4</strong>
functions. </p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14834 Aux Id: PR 1608 </p> </li><li> <p>Added <strong>ets:whereis/1</strong> for retrieving the table
identifier of a named table.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14884</p> </li><li> <p>
Improved URI normalization functions in the uri_string
module.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14910</p> </li><li> <p> The new functions <strong>io_lib:fwrite/3</strong> and
<strong>io_lib:format/3</strong> take a third argument, an option
list. The only option is <strong>chars_limit</strong>, which is
used for limiting the number of returned characters. The
limit is soft, which means that the number of returned
characters exceeds the limit with at most a smallish
amount. If the limit is set, the functions
<strong>format/3</strong> and <strong>fwrite/3</strong> try to distribute the
number of characters evenly over the control sequences
<strong>pPswW</strong>. Furthermore, the control sequences
<strong>pPwP</strong> try to distribute the number of characters
evenly over substructures. </p> <p> A modification of the
control sequences <strong>pPwW</strong> is that even if there is no
limit on the number of returned characters, all
associations of a map are printed to the same depth. The
aim is to give a more consistent output as the order of
map keys is not defined. As before, if the depth is less
than the number of associations of a map, the selection
of associations to print is arbitrary. </p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14983</p> </li><li> <p> Add functions <strong>ordsets:is_empty/1</strong> and
<strong>sets:is_empty/1</strong>. </p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14996 Aux Id: ERL-557, PR-1703 </p> </li><li> <p>
Improve performance of <strong>string:uppercase/1</strong>,
<strong>string:lowercase/1</strong> and <strong>string:casefold/1</strong>
when handling ASCII characters.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14998</p> </li><li> <p>External funs with literal values for module, name,
and arity (e.g. <strong>erlang:abs/1</strong>) are now treated as
literals. That means more efficient code that produces
less garbage on the heap.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15003</p> </li><li> <p>
sys:statistics(Pid,get) did not report 'out' messages
from gen_server. This is now corrected.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15047</p> </li><li> <p>
A sys debug function can now have the format
{Id,Fun,State} in addition to the old {Fun,State}. This
allows installing multiple instances of a debug fun.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15048</p> </li><li> <p> The <strong>lib</strong> module is removed:</p> <ul><li><strong>lib:error_message/2</strong> is removed.</li><li><strong>lib:flush_receive/0</strong> is removed.</li><li><strong>lib:nonl/1</strong> is removed.</li><li><strong>lib:progname/0</strong> is replaced by <strong>ct:get_progname/0</strong>.</li><li><strong>lib:send/2</strong> is removed.</li><li><strong>lib:sendw/2</strong> is removed.</li></ul> <p>

Own Id: OTP-15072 Aux Id: PR 1786, OTP-15114 </p> </li><li> <p>
Function <strong>ets:delete_all_objects/1</strong> now yields the
scheduler thread for large tables that take significant
time to clear. This to improve real time characteristics
of other runnable processes.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15078</p> </li><li> <p> In control sequences of the functions
<strong>io:fwrite/2,3</strong> and <strong>io_lib:fwrite/2,3</strong>
containing <strong>p</strong> or <strong>P</strong>, a field width of value
<strong>0</strong> means that no line breaks are inserted. This is
in contrast to the old behaviour, where <strong>0</strong> used to
insert line breaks after every subterm. To insert line
breaks after every subterm, a field width of value
<strong>1</strong> can be used. </p> <p>

Improved unicode support for strings. Added normalization
functions in the <strong>unicode</strong> module. Extended the

unicode handling and that works on grapheme clusters. The
new functions operates on the <strong>unicode:chardata()</strong>
type, thus they also accept <strong>UTF-8 binaries</strong> as

Upgraded the OTP internal PCRE library from version 8.33
to version 8.40. This library is used for implementation
of the <a href="./re">stdlib/re</a>
regular expressions module.</p> <p>
Besides various bug fixes, the new version allows for
better stack protection. In order to utilize this
feature, the stack size of normal scheduler threads is
now by default set to 128 kilo words on all platforms.
The stack size of normal scheduler threads can be set
upon system start by passing the <a href="../erts/erl#sched_thread_stack_size">erts/erl#sched_thread_stack_size</a>
command line argument to the <a href="./erl">erts/erl</a> command.</p> <p>

Bug fixes, new features and improvements to gen_statem:</p> <p>
A new type init_result/1 has replaced the old
init_result/0, so if you used that old type (that was
never documented) you have to change your code, which may
be regarded as a potential incompatibility.</p> <p>
Changing callback modes after code change did not work
since the new callback mode was not recorded. This bug
has been fixed.</p> <p>
The event types state_timeout and {call,From} could not
be generated with a {next_event,EventType,EventContent}
action since they did not pass the runtime type check.
This bug has now been corrected.</p> <p>
State entry calls can now be repeated using (new) state
callback returns {repeat_state,...},
{repeat_state_and_data,_} and repeat_state_and_data.</p> <p>
There have been lots of code cleanup in particular
regarding timer handling. For example is async
cancel_timer now used. Error handling has also been
cleaned up.</p> <p>

Own Id: OTP-11879</p> </li><li> <p>The '<strong>random</strong>' module has been deprecated. Use
the '<strong>rand</strong>' module instead.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-12502 Aux Id: OTP-12501 </p> </li><li> <p>Background: In record fields with a type declaration
but without an initializer, the Erlang parser inserted
automatically the singleton type <strong>'undefined'</strong> to
the list of declared types, if that value was not present
there. That is, the record declaration:</p> <p>
-record(rec, {f1 :: float(), f2 = 42 :: integer(), f3 ::
some_mod:some_typ()}).</p> <p>was translated by the parser to:</p> <p>
-record(rec, {f1 :: float() | 'undefined', f2 = 42 ::
integer(), f3 :: some_mod:some_typ() | 'undefined'}).</p> <p>The rationale for this was that creation of a "dummy"
<strong>#rec{}</strong> record should not result in a warning from
dialyzer that, for example, the implicit initialization
of the <strong>#rec.f1</strong> field violates its type
declaration.</p> <p>Problems: This seemingly innocent action has some
unforeseen consequences.</p> <p>For starters, there is no way for programmers to
declare that e.g. only floats make sense for the
<strong>f1</strong> field of <strong>#rec{}</strong> records when there is no
"obvious" default initializer for this field. (This also
affects tools like PropEr that use these declarations
produced by the Erlang parser to generate random
instances of records for testing purposes.)</p> <p>It also means that dialyzer does not warn if e.g. an
<strong>is_atom/1</strong> test or something more exotic like an
<strong>atom_to_list/1</strong> call is performed on the value of
the <strong>f1</strong> field.</p> <p>Similarly, there is no way to extend dialyzer to warn
if it finds record constructions where <strong>f1</strong> is not
initialized to some float.</p> <p>Last but not least, it is semantically problematic
when the type of the field is an opaque type: creating a
union of an opaque and a structured type is very
problematic for analysis because it fundamentally breaks
the opacity of the term at that point.</p> <p>Change: To solve these problems the parser will not
automatically insert the <strong>'undefined'</strong> value
anymore; instead the user has the option to choose the
places where this value makes sense (for the field) and
where it does not and insert the <strong>| 'undefined'</strong>
there manually.</p> <p>Consequences of this change: This change means that
dialyzer will issue a warning for all places where
records with uninitialized fields are created and those
fields have a declared type that is incompatible with
<strong>'undefined'</strong> (e.g. <strong>float()</strong>). This warning
can be suppressed easily by adding <strong>| 'undefined'</strong>
to the type of this field. This also adds documentation
that the user really intends to create records where this
field is uninitialized.</p> <p>

enough to be used by at least two heavy OTP applications,

Optimize binary:split/2 and binary:split/3 with native

Own Id: OTP-13082</p> </li><li> <p>Background: The types of record fields have since R12B
been put in a separate form by <strong>epp:parse_file()</strong>,
leaving the record declaration form untyped. The separate
form, however, does not follow the syntax of type
declarations, and parse transforms inspecting
<strong>-type()</strong> attributes need to know about the special
syntax. Since the compiler stores the return value of
<strong>epp:parse_file()</strong> as debug information in the
abstract code chunk (<strong>"Abst"</strong> or
<strong>abstract_code</strong>), tools too need to know about the
special syntax, if they inspect <strong>-type()</strong> attributes
in abstract code.</p> <p>Change: No separate type form is created by
<strong>epp:parse_file()</strong>, but the type information is kept
in the record fields. This means that all parse
transforms and all tools inspecting <strong>-record()</strong>
declarations need to recognize <strong>{typed_record_field, Field, Type}</strong>.</p> <p>

also implemented by the generic behaviours
<strong>gen_server</strong>, <strong>gen_event</strong> and <strong>gen_fsm</strong>.</p> <p>
The potential incompatibility refers to:</p> <ul><li>The previous behaviour of intercepting the system message and passing a tuple of size 2 as the last argument to <strong>sys:handle_system_msg/6</strong> is no longer supported.</li><li>The error handling when <strong>StateFun</strong> in <strong>sys:replace_state/2,3</strong> fails is changed from being totally silent to possibly (if the callback module does not catch) throw an exception in the client process.</li></ul> <p>

Properties support. New options connected to PCRE 8.33
are also added to the re module (ucd, notempty_atstart,

A call to either the <strong>garbage_collect/1</strong> BIF or the
<strong>check_process_code/2</strong> BIF may trigger garbage
collection of another processes than the process calling
the BIF. The previous implementations performed these
kinds of garbage collections without considering the
internal state of the process being garbage collected. In
order to be able to more easily and more efficiently
implement yielding native code, these types of garbage
collections have been rewritten. A garbage collection
like this is now triggered by an asynchronous request
signal, the actual garbage collection is performed by the
process being garbage collected itself, and finalized by
a reply signal to the process issuing the request. Using
this approach processes can disable garbage collection
and yield without having to set up the heap in a state
that can be garbage collected.</p> <p>
The <a href="../erts/erlang#garbage_collect/2">erts/erlang#garbage_collect/2</a>,
and <a href="../erts/erlang#check_process_code/3">erts/erlang#check_process_code/3</a>
BIFs have been introduced. Both taking an option list as
last argument. Using these, one can issue asynchronous
requests.</p> <p>
<strong>code:purge/1</strong> and <strong>code:soft_purge/1</strong> have
been rewritten to utilize asynchronous
<strong>check_process_code</strong> requests in order to
parallelize work.</p> <p>
Characteristics impact: A call to the
<strong>garbage_collect/1</strong> BIF or the
<strong>check_process_code/2</strong> BIF will normally take longer
time to complete while the system as a whole wont be as
much negatively effected by the operation as before. A
call to <strong>code:purge/1</strong> and <strong>code:soft_purge/1</strong>
may complete faster or slower depending on the state of
the system while the system as a whole wont be as much
negatively effected by the operation as before.</p> <p>

In order to be able to support elliptic curve cipher

Leave control back to gen_server during supervisor's
restart loop</p> <p>
When an attempt to restart a child failed, supervisor
would earlier keep the execution flow and try to restart
the child over and over again until it either succeeded
or the restart frequency limit was reached. If none of
these happened, supervisor would hang forever in this
loop.</p> <p>
This commit adds a timer of 0 ms where the control is
left back to the gen_server which implements the
supervisor. This way any incoming request to the
supervisor will be handled - which could help breaking
the infinite loop - e.g. shutdown request for the
supervisor or for the problematic child.</p> <p>
This introduces some incompatibilities in stdlib due to
new return values from supervisor:</p> <ul><li>restart_child/2 can now return {error,restarting}</li><li>delete_child/2 can now return {error,restarting}</li><li>which_children/1 returns a list of {Id,Child,Type,Mods}, where Child, in addition to the old pid() or 'undefined', now also can be 'restarting'.</li></ul> <p>

bug has been corrected by changing the behaviour of

the output port driver buffers got lost when printing on
a TTY and exiting through erlang:halt/0,1. </p> <p> The BIF:s erlang:halt/0,1 has gotten improved
semantics and there is a new BIF erlang:halt/2 to
accomplish something like the old semantics. See the
documentation. </p> <p> Now erlang:halt/0 and erlang:halt/1 with an integer
argument will close all ports and allow all pending async
threads operations to finish before exiting the emulator.
Previously erlang:halt/0 and erlang:halt(0) would just
wait for pending async threads operations but not close
ports. And erlang:halt/1 with a non-zero integer argument
would not even wait for pending async threads operations.
</p> <p> To roughly the old behaviour, to not wait for ports
and async threads operations when you exit the emulator,
you use erlang:halt/2 with an integer first argument and
an option list containing {flush,false} as the second
argument. Note that now is flushing not dependant of the
exit code, and you cannot only flush async threads
operations which we deemed as a strange behaviour anyway.
</p> <p>Also, erlang:halt/1,2 has gotten a new feature: If the
first argument is the atom 'abort' the emulator is
aborted producing a core dump, if the operating system so
allows. </p> <p>

Explicitly kill dynamic children in supervisors</p> <p>
According to the supervisor's documentation: "Important
note on simple-one-for-one supervisors: The dynamically
created child processes of a simple-one-for-one
supervisor are not explicitly killed, regardless of
shutdown strategy, but are expected to terminate when the
supervisor does (that is, when an exit signal from the
parent process is received)."</p> <p>
All is fine as long as we stop simple_one_for_one
supervisor manually. Dynamic children catch the exit
signal from the supervisor and leave. But, if this
happens when we stop an application, after the top
supervisor has stopped, the application master kills all
remaining processes associated to this application. So,
dynamic children that trap exit signals can be killed
during their cleanup (here we mean inside terminate/2).
This is unpredictable and highly time-dependent.</p> <p>
In this commit, supervisor module is patched to
explicitly terminate dynamic children accordingly to the
shutdown strategy.</p> <p>
NOTE: Order in which dynamic children are stopped is not
defined. In fact, this is "almost" done at the same time.</p> <p>
Stack errors when dynamic children are stopped</p> <p>
Because a simple_one_for_one supervisor can have many
workers, we stack errors during its shutdown to report
only one message for each encountered error type. Instead
of reporting the child's pid, we use the number of
concerned children. (Thanks to Christopher Faulet)</p> <p>

Allow an infinite timeout to shutdown worker processes</p> <p>
Now, in child specification, the shutdown value can also

application-dependent. Add a warning to docs about
workers' shutdown strategy (Thanks to Christopher Faulet)</p> <p>

fix supervisors restarting temporary children</p> <p>
In the current implementation of supervisors, temporary
children should never be restarted. However, when a
temporary child is restarted as part of a one_for_all or
rest_for_one strategy where the failing process is not
the temporary child, the supervisor still tries to
restart it.</p> <p>
Because the supervisor doesn't keep some of the MFA
information of temporary children, this causes the
supervisor to hit its restart limit and crash.</p> <p>
This patch fixes the behaviour by inserting a clause in
terminate_children/2-3 (private function) that will omit
temporary children when building a list of killed
processes, to avoid having the supervisor trying to
restart them again.</p> <p>
Only supervisors in need of restarting children used the
list, so the change should be of no impact for the
functions that called terminate_children/2-3 only to kill
all children.</p> <p>
The documentation has been modified to make this
behaviour more explicit. (Thanks to Fred Hebert)</p> <p>

Large parts of the <strong>ethread</strong> library have been
rewritten. The <strong>ethread</strong> library is an Erlang
runtime system internal, portable thread library used by
the runtime system itself.</p> <p>
Most notable improvement is a reader optimized rwlock
implementation which dramatically improve the performance
of read-lock/read-unlock operations on multi processor
systems by avoiding ping-ponging of the rwlock cache
lines. The reader optimized rwlock implementation is used
by miscellaneous rwlocks in the runtime system that are
known to be read-locked frequently, and can be enabled on
ETS tables by passing the <a href="../stdlib/ets#new_2_read_concurrency">{read_concurrency, true}</a> option upon table creation. See the
documentation of <a href="../stdlib/ets#new/2">ets:new/2</a> for more
information. The reader optimized rwlock implementation
can be fine tuned when starting the runtime system. For
more information, see the documentation of the <a href="../erts/erl#+rg">+rg</a> command line argument
of <strong>erl</strong>.</p> <p>
There is also a new implementation of rwlocks that is not
optimized for readers. Both implementations interleaves
readers and writers during contention as opposed to,
e.g., the NPTL (Linux) pthread rwlock implementation
which use either a reader or writer preferred strategy.
The reader/writer preferred strategy is problematic since
it starves threads doing the non-preferred operation.</p> <p>
The new rwlock implementations in general performs better
in ERTS than common pthread implementations. However, in
some extremely heavily contended cases this is not the
case. Such heavy contention can more or less only appear
on ETS tables. This when multiple processes do very large
amounts of write locked operations simultaneously on the
same table. Such use of ETS is bad regardless of rwlock
implementation, will never scale, and is something we
strongly advise against.</p> <p>
The new rwlock implementations depend on atomic
operations. If no native atomic implementation is found,
a fallback solution will be used. Using the fallback
implies a performance degradation. That is, it is more
important now than before to build OTP with a native
atomic implementation.</p> <p>
The <strong>ethread</strong> library contains native atomic
implementations for, x86 (32 and 64 bit), powerpc (32
bit), sparc V9 (32 and 64 bit), and tilera (32 bit). On
other hardware gcc's builtin support for atomic memory
access will be used if such exists. If no such support is
found, <strong>configure</strong> will warn about no atomic
implementation available.</p> <p>
The <strong>ethread</strong> library can now also use the
<strong>libatomic_ops</strong> library for atomic memory accesses.
This makes it possible for the Erlang runtime system to
utilize optimized native atomic operations on more
platforms than before. If <strong>configure</strong> warns about no
atomic implementation available, try using the
<strong>libatomic_ops</strong> library. Use the <a href="../doc/installation_guide/INSTALL#Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP">--with-libatomic_ops=PATH</a>
<strong>configure</strong> command line argument when specifying
where the <strong>libatomic_ops</strong> installation is located.
The <strong>libatomic_ops</strong> library can be downloaded from:
<a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/">http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/</a></p> <p>
The changed API of the <strong>ethread</strong> library has also
caused modifications in the Erlang runtime system.
Preparations for the to come "delayed deallocation"
feature has also been done since it depends on the
<strong>ethread</strong> library.</p> <p>
<em>Note</em>: When building for x86, the <strong>ethread</strong>
library will now use instructions that first appeared on
the pentium 4 processor. If you want the runtime system
to be compatible with older processors (back to 486) you
need to pass the <a href="../doc/installation_guide/INSTALL#Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP">--enable-ethread-pre-pentium4-compatibility</a>
<strong>configure</strong> command line argument when configuring
the system.</p> <p>

specific BIF by using the new compiler directive

calls to the local or imported function without explicit

change makes it possible to add auto-imported BIFs

io:get_line/get_chars when the io_server is set in

has been changed slightly in the rare case that when the
caller was linked to the called server, and the server
crashed during the call; its exit signal was consumed by
the gen:call/3,4 code and converted to an exit exception.
This exit signal is no longer consumed.</p> <p>To even notice this change, 1) the calling process has
to be linked to the called server.</p> <p>
2) the call must not be remote by name that is it must be
local or remote by pid, local by name or global by name.</p> <p>
3) the calling process has to have set
<strong>process_flag(trap_exit, true)</strong>.</p> <p>
4) the server has to crash during the call.</p> <p>
5) the calling process has to be sensitive to getting
previously consumed <strong>{'EXIT',Pid,Reason}</strong> messages
in its message queue.</p> <p>The old behaviour was once the only way for a client
to notice if the server died, but has since
<strong>erlang:monitor(process, {Name,Node})</strong> was
introduced and used in gen:call been regarded as an
undesired behaviour if not a bug.</p> <p>The affected user APIs are:

to the <strong>qlc</strong> module. There are two kinds of fast
joins: lookup join that uses existing indices, and merge
join that takes two sorted inputs. There is a new
<strong>join</strong> option that can be used to force QLC to use a
particular kind of join in some QLC expression.</p> <p>Several other changes have also been included:</p> <ul><li> <p>The new <strong>tmpdir</strong> option of <strong>cursor/2</strong>,
<strong>eval/2</strong>, <strong>fold/4</strong>, and <strong>info/2</strong> can be
used to set the directory that join uses for temporary
files. The option also overrides the <strong>tmpdir</strong> option
of <strong>keysort/3</strong> and <strong>sort/2</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p>The new <strong>lookup</strong> option can be used to
assert that constants are looked up when evaluating some
QLC expression.</p> </li><li> <p>The <strong>cache</strong> and <strong>cache_all</strong> options
accept new tags: <strong>ets</strong>, <strong>list</strong>, and <strong>no</strong>.
The tag <strong>list</strong> caches answers in a list using a
temporary file if the answers cannot be held in RAM.
Combining <strong>{cache,list}</strong> and <strong>{unique, true}</strong>
is equivalent to calling <strong>sort/2</strong> with the option
<strong>unique</strong> set to <strong>true</strong>. The old tags
<strong>true</strong> (equivalent to <strong>ets</strong>) and <strong>false</strong>
(equivalent to <strong>no</strong>) are recognized for backward
compatibility.</p> </li><li> <p>The new option <strong>max_list_size</strong> can be used
to set the limit where merge join starts to use temporary
files for large equivalence classes and when answers
cached in lists are put on temporary files.</p> </li><li> <p>There is a new callback <strong>is_sorted_key</strong> to
be supplied as an option to <strong>table/2</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p>QLC analyzes each and every QLC expression when
trying to find constants for the lookup function.
Hitherto only QLC expressions with exactly one generator
were analyzed.</p> <p>Note that only filters with guard
syntax placed immediately after the generator are
analyzed. The restriction to guard filters is an
incompatible change. See <strong>qlc(3)</strong> for further
details.</p> </li><li> <p>In a similar way several match specifications
for traversal of QLC tables can be utilized for different
generators of one single QLC expression.</p> </li><li> <p>A bug has been fixed: when caching answers to a
sufficiently complex query it could happen that some
answers were not returned.</p> </li></ul> <p>*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-6038</p> </li><li> <p>The Erlang pretty printer (<strong>erl_pp</strong>) is now much

binaries. Under certain circumstances such binaries could
otherwise linger on for an indefinite amount of time.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-6239</p> </li><li> <p>To help Dialyzer find more bugs, many functions in the
Kernel and STDLIB applications now only accept arguments
of the type that is documented.</p> <p>For instance, the functions <strong>lists:prefix/2</strong> and
<strong>lists:suffix/2</strong> are documented to only accept lists
as their arguments, but they actually accepted anything
and returned <strong>false</strong>. That has been changed so that
the functions cause an exception if one or both arguments
are not lists.</p> <p>Also, the <strong>string:strip/3</strong> function is documented
to take a character argument that is a character to strip
from one or both ends of the string. Given a list instead
of a character, it used to do nothing, but will now cause
an exception.</p> <p>Dialyzer will find most cases where those functions
are passed arguments of the wrong type.</p> <p>*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-6295</p> </li></ul><h2>STDLIB 1.14.1</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>The functions <strong>c:y/1,2</strong> which call

backwards compatibility in STDLIB 1.13.1. The flag to be
used for this is now called <strong>async_shell_start</strong> and has
been documented. New shells started from the JCL menu are
not synchronized with <strong>init</strong> anymore. This makes it

<strong>c:i/0</strong> instead.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5432</p> </li><li> <p>Corrected two minor bugs found by the Dialyzer:
Calling a parameterized module from a restricted shell
(i.e. if <strong>shell:start_restricted/1</strong> has been used)
would crash the shell evaluator. A debug printout in
<strong>gen_fsm</strong> had a clause that would never match; causing
less information to be printed.</p> <p>And a somewhat more serious one also found by
Dialyzer: <strong>rpc:yield/1</strong> would crash unless the call
started by <strong>rpc:async_call/4</strong> had already finished;
<strong>rpc:nb_yield(Key,infinity)</strong> would also crash.</p> <p>Cleaned up and removed redundant code found by
Dialyzer in <strong>erlang:dmonitor_p/2</strong>.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5462</p> </li></ul><h2>STDLIB 1.13.4</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>Bugs in the Erlang shell have been fixed.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5327</p> </li><li> <p>Some dead code reported by Dialyzer was eliminated.</p> <p>A bug in <strong>dbg</strong> when tracing to wrap trace files has

that relies on <strong>gb_sets:del_element/2</strong> causing an
error if the element does not exist must be changed to
