the BEAM Compiler ("BEAM files"). The format used, a variant of
"EA IFF 1985" Standard for Interchange Format Files, divides data
into chunks.Chunk data can be returned as binaries or as compound terms.
Compound terms are returned when chunks are referenced by names
(atoms) rather than identifiers (strings). The recognized names
and the corresponding identifiers are as follows:<ul><li><strong>atoms ("Atom")</strong></li><li><strong>attributes ("Attr")</strong></li><li><strong>compile_info ("CInf")</strong></li><li><strong>debug_info ("Dbgi")</strong></li><li><strong>exports ("ExpT")</strong></li><li><strong>imports ("ImpT")</strong></li><li><strong>indexed_imports ("ImpT")</strong></li><li><strong>labeled_exports ("ExpT")</strong></li><li><strong>labeled_locals ("LocT")</strong></li><li><strong>locals ("LocT")</strong></li></ul></p><a name="debug_info"></a><h2>Debug Information/Abstract Code</h2><p>Option <strong>debug_info</strong> can be specified to the Compiler (see
<a href="../compiler/compile#debug_info">compiler/compile#debug_info</a>)
to have debug information, such as <a href="./absform">Erlang Abstract Format</a>, stored in the <strong>debug_info</strong> chunk.
Tools such as Debugger and Xref require the debug information to
be included.</p><div class="alert alert-warning"><h4 class="alert-heading">Warning</h4><p>Source code can be reconstructed from the debug information.
To prevent this, use encrypted debug information (see below).</p></div><p>The debug information can also be removed from BEAM files
using <a href="#strip/1">strip/1</a>,
<a href="#strip_files/1">strip_files/1</a>, and/or
<a href="#strip_release/1">strip_release/1</a>.</p><h2>Reconstruct Source Code</h2><p>The following example shows how to reconstruct Erlang source code from
the debug information in a BEAM file <strong>Beam</strong>:</p><pre><code class="">
{ok,{_,[{abstract_code,{_,AC}}]}} = beam_lib:chunks(Beam,[abstract_code]).
io:fwrite("~s~n", [erl_prettypr:format(erl_syntax:form_list(AC))]).</code></pre><h2>Encrypted Debug Information</h2><p>The debug information can be encrypted to keep
the source code secret, but still be able to use tools such as
Debugger or Xref.</p><p>To use encrypted debug information, a key must be provided to
the compiler and <strong>beam_lib</strong>. The key is specified as a string.
It is recommended that the string contains at least 32 characters and
that both upper and lower case letters as well as digits and
special characters are used.</p><p>The default type (and currently the only type) of crypto
algorithm is <strong>des3_cbc</strong>, three rounds of DES. The key string
is scrambled using
<a href="../erts/erlang#md5/1">erts/erlang#md5/1</a>
to generate the keys used for <strong>des3_cbc</strong>.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>As far as we know by the time of writing, it is
infeasible to break <strong>des3_cbc</strong> encryption without any
knowledge of the key. Therefore, as long as the key is kept
safe and is unguessable, the encrypted debug information
<em>should</em> be safe from intruders.</p></div><p>The key can be provided in the following two ways:</p><ul><li> <p>Use Compiler option <strong>{debug_info_key,Key}</strong>, see
<a href="../compiler/compile#debug_info_key">compiler/compile#debug_info_key</a>
and function
<a href="#crypto_key_fun/1">crypto_key_fun/1</a>
to register a fun that returns the key whenever
<strong>beam_lib</strong> must decrypt the debug information.</p> <p>If no such fun is registered, <strong>beam_lib</strong> instead
searches for an <strong>.erlang.crypt</strong> file, see the next section.</p> </li><li> <p>Store the key in a text file named <strong>.erlang.crypt</strong>.</p> <p>In this case, Compiler option <strong>encrypt_debug_info</strong>
can be used, see
<a href="../compiler/compile#encrypt_debug_info">compiler/compile#encrypt_debug_info</a>.
</p> </li></ul><h2>.erlang.crypt</h2><p><strong>beam_lib</strong> searches for <strong>.erlang.crypt</strong> in the current
directory and then the home directory for the current user. If
the file is found and contains a key, <strong>beam_lib</strong>
implicitly creates a crypto key fun and registers it.</p><p>File <strong>.erlang.crypt</strong> is to contain a single list of tuples:</p><pre><code class="">
{debug_info, Mode, Module, Key}</code></pre><p><strong>Mode</strong> is the type of crypto algorithm; currently, the only
allowed value is <strong>des3_cbc</strong>. <strong>Module</strong> is either an
atom, in which case <strong>Key</strong> is only used for the module
<strong>Module</strong>, or <strong>[]</strong>, in which case <strong>Key</strong> is
used for all modules. <strong>Key</strong> is the non-empty key string.</p><p><strong>Key</strong> in the first tuple where both <strong>Mode</strong> and
<strong>Module</strong> match is used.</p><p>The following is an example of an <strong>.erlang.crypt</strong> file that returns
the same key for all modules:</p><pre><code class="">
[{debug_info, des3_cbc, [], "%&gt;7}|pc/DM6Cga*68$Mw]L#&amp;_Gejr]G^"}].</code></pre><p>The following is a slightly more complicated example of an
<strong>.erlang.crypt</strong> providing one key for module
<strong>t</strong> and another key for all other modules:</p><pre><code class="">
[{debug_info, des3_cbc, t, "My KEY"},
 {debug_info, des3_cbc, [], "%&gt;7}|pc/DM6Cga*68$Mw]L#&amp;_Gejr]G^"}].</code></pre><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>Do not use any of the keys in these examples. Use your own keys.</p></div><h1>Data Types</h1><span class="name">beam</span><p>Each of the functions described below accept either the
filename (as a string) or a binary containing the BEAM
module.</p><span class="name">chunkdata</span><p>The list of attributes is sorted on <strong>Attribute</strong>
(in <strong>attrib_entry()</strong>) and each
attribute name occurs once in the list. The attribute values
occur in the same order as in the file. The lists of functions
are also sorted.</p><span class="name">chunkid</span><p>"Attr" | "CInf" | "Dbgi" | "ExpT" | "ImpT" | "LocT" | "AtU8"</p><span class="name">dataB</span><span class="name">debug_info</span><p>The format stored in the <strong>debug_info</strong> chunk.
To retrieve particular code representation from the backend,
<strong>Backend:debug_info(Format, Module, Data, Opts)</strong> must be
invoked. <strong>Format</strong> is an atom, such as <strong>erlang_v1</strong> for
the Erlang Abstract Format or <strong>core_v1</strong> for Core Erlang.
<strong>Module</strong> is the module represented by the beam file and
<strong>Data</strong> is the value stored in the debug info chunk.
<strong>Opts</strong> is any list of values supported by the <strong>Backend</strong>.
<strong>Backend:debug_info/4</strong> must return <strong>{ok, Code}</strong> or
<strong>{error, Term}</strong>.</p><p>Developers must always invoke the <strong>debug_info/4</strong> function
and never rely on the <strong>Data</strong> stored in the <strong>debug_info</strong>
chunk, as it is opaque and may change at any moment. <strong>no_debug_info</strong>
means that chunk <strong>"Dbgi"</strong> is present, but empty.</p><span class="name">abst_code</span><p>It is not checked that the forms conform to the abstract format
indicated by <strong><span class="anno">AbstVersion</span></strong>. <strong>no_abstract_code</strong>
means that chunk <strong>"Abst"</strong> is present, but empty.</p><p>For modules compiled with OTP 20 onwards, the <strong>abst_code</strong> chunk
is automatically computed from the <strong>debug_info</strong> chunk.</p><span class="name">forms</span><span class="name">compinfo_entry</span><span class="name">attrib_entry</span><span class="name">labeled_entry</span><span class="name">index</span><span class="name">label</span><span class="name">chunkref</span><span class="name">chunkname</span><span class="name">chnk_rsn</span><span class="name">info_rsn</span><h1>Functions</h1><h2>all_chunks/1</h2><p>Read all chunks from a BEAM file or binary</p><p>Reads chunk data for all chunks.</p><h2>build_module/1</h2><p>Create a BEAM module from a list of chunks.</p><p>Builds a BEAM module (as a binary) from a list of chunks.</p><h2>chunks/2</h2><p>Read selected chunks from a BEAM file or binary.</p><p>Reads chunk data for selected chunks references.

<strong><span class="anno">Beam</span></strong>, an <strong>error</strong> tuple is returned.
However, if option <strong>allow_missing_chunks</strong> is specified,
a result is returned even if chunks are missing.
In the result list, any missing chunks are represented as
<strong>{<span class="anno">ChunkRef</span>,missing_chunk}</strong>.
Notice however that if chunk <strong>"Atom"</strong> is missing, that is
considered a fatal error and the return value is an <strong>error</strong>
tuple.</p><h2>clear_crypto_key_fun/0</h2><p>Unregister the current crypto key fun.</p><p>Unregisters the crypto key fun and terminates the process
