in any <strong>gen_event</strong> process. It logs onto disk all events that are
sent to an event manager. Each event is written as a binary, which makes
the logging very fast. However, a tool such as the Report Browser
(<a href="./rb">sasl/rb</a>) must be used to read
the files. The events are written to multiple files. When all files have
been used, the first one is reused and overwritten. The directory
location, the number of files, and the size of each file are configurable.
The directory will include one file called <strong>index</strong>, and report files
<strong>1, 2, ...</strong>.</p><h1>Data Types</h1><span class="name">args</span><p>Term to be sent to <a href="./gen_event#add_handler/3">gen_event#add_handler/3</a>.</p><h1>Functions</h1><h2>init/3</h2><h2>init/4</h2><p>Initiate the event handler.</p><p>Initiates the event handler.
