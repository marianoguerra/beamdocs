for entering expression sequences. The expressions are
evaluated and a value is returned.
A history mechanism saves previous commands and their
values, which can then be incorporated in later commands.
How many commands and results to save can be determined by the user,
either interactively, by calling
<a href="#history/1">history/1</a> and
<a href="#results/1">results/1</a>,
or by setting the application configuration
parameters <strong>shell_history_length</strong> and
<strong>shell_saved_results</strong> for the STDLIB application.The shell uses a helper process for evaluating commands
to protect the history mechanism from exceptions. By
default the evaluator process is killed when an exception
occurs, but by calling <a href="#catch_exception/1">catch_exception/1</a> or by
setting the application configuration parameter
<strong>shell_catch_exception</strong> for the STDLIB application
this behavior can be changed. See also the example below.Variable bindings, and local process dictionary changes
that are generated in user expressions are preserved, and the variables
can be used in later commands to access their values. The
bindings can also be forgotten so the variables can be reused.The special shell commands all have the syntax of (local)
function calls. They are evaluated as
normal function calls and many commands can be used in one
expression sequence.If a command (local function call) is not recognized by the
shell, an attempt is first made to find the function in
module <strong>user_default</strong>, where customized local commands
can be placed. If found, the function is evaluated,
otherwise an attempt is made to evaluate the function in
module <strong>shell_default</strong>. Module
<strong>user_default</strong> must be explicitly loaded.The shell also permits the user to start multiple concurrent
jobs. A job can be regarded as a set of processes that can
communicate with the shell.There is some support for reading and printing records in
the shell. During compilation record expressions are translated
to tuple expressions. In runtime it is not known whether a tuple
represents a record, and the record definitions
used by the compiler are unavailable at runtime. So, to read the
record syntax and print tuples as records when possible, record
definitions must be maintained by the shell itself.The shell commands for reading, defining, forgetting, listing, and
printing records are described below. Notice that each job has its
own set of record definitions. To facilitate matters, record
definitions in modules <strong>shell_default</strong> and
<strong>user_default</strong> (if loaded) are read each time a new job is
started. For example, adding the following line
to <strong>user_default</strong> makes the definition of <strong>file_info</strong>
readily available in the shell:<pre><code class="">
-include_lib("kernel/include/file.hrl").</code></pre>The shell runs in two modes:<ul><li> <p><strong>Normal (possibly restricted)</strong> mode, in which
commands can be edited and expressions evaluated</p> </li><li> <p>Job Control Mode, <strong>JCL</strong>, in which jobs can be
started, killed, detached, and connected</p> </li></ul>Only the currently connected job can 'talk' to the shell.</p><h2>Shell Commands</h2><dl><dt><strong>b()</strong></dt><dd> <p>Prints the current variable bindings.</p> </dd><dt><strong>f()</strong></dt><dd> <p>Removes all variable bindings.</p> </dd><dt><strong>f(X)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Removes the binding of variable <strong>X</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>h()</strong></dt><dd> <p>Prints the history list.</p> </dd><dt><strong>history(N)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Sets the number of previous commands to keep in the
history list to <strong>N</strong>. The previous number is returned.
Defaults to 20.</p> </dd><dt><strong>results(N)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Sets the number of results from previous commands to keep in
the history list to <strong>N</strong>. The previous number is returned.
Defaults to 20.</p> </dd><dt><strong>e(N)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Repeats command <strong>N</strong>, if <strong>N</strong> is positive. If
it is negative, the <strong>N</strong>th previous command is repeated
(that is, <strong>e(-1)</strong> repeats the previous command).</p> </dd><dt><strong>v(N)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Uses the return value of command <strong>N</strong> in the
current command, if <strong>N</strong> is positive. If it is negative,
the return value of the <strong>N</strong>th previous command is used
(that is, <strong>v(-1)</strong> uses the value of the previous command).</p> </dd><dt><strong>help()</strong></dt><dd> <p>Evaluates <strong>shell_default:help()</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>c(Mod)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Evaluates <strong>shell_default:c(Mod)</strong>. This compiles and
loads the module <strong>Mod</strong> and purges old versions of the
code, if necessary. <strong>Mod</strong> can be either a module name or a
a source file path, with or without <strong>.erl</strong> extension.</p> </dd><dt><strong>catch_exception(Bool)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Sets the exception handling of the evaluator process. The
previous exception handling is returned. The default
(<strong>false</strong>) is to kill the evaluator process when an
exception occurs, which causes the shell to create a new
evaluator process. When the exception handling is set to
<strong>true</strong>, the evaluator process lives on. This means,
for example, that ports and ETS tables as well as processes
linked to the evaluator process survive the exception.</p> </dd><dt><strong>rd(RecordName, RecordDefinition)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Defines a record in the shell. <strong>RecordName</strong> is
an atom and <strong>RecordDefinition</strong> lists the field names
and the default values. Usually record definitions are made
known to the shell by use of the <strong>rr/1,2,3</strong> commands
described below, but sometimes it is handy to define records
on the fly.</p> </dd><dt><strong>rf()</strong></dt><dd> <p>Removes all record definitions, then reads record
definitions from the modules <strong>shell_default</strong> and
<strong>user_default</strong> (if loaded). Returns the names of the
records defined.</p> </dd><dt><strong>rf(RecordNames)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Removes selected record definitions.
<strong>RecordNames</strong> is a record name or a list of record names.
To remove all record definitions, use <strong>'_'</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>rl()</strong></dt><dd> <p>Prints all record definitions.</p> </dd><dt><strong>rl(RecordNames)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Prints selected record definitions.
<strong>RecordNames</strong> is a record name or a list of record names.</p> </dd><dt><strong>rp(Term)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Prints a term using the record definitions known to the
shell. All of <strong>Term</strong> is printed; the depth is not
limited as is the case when a return value is printed.</p> </dd><dt><strong>rr(Module)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Reads record definitions from a module's BEAM file. If
there are no record definitions in the BEAM file, the
source file is located and read instead. Returns the names
of the record definitions read. <strong>Module</strong> is an atom.</p> </dd><dt><strong>rr(Wildcard)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Reads record definitions from files. Existing
definitions of any of the record names read are replaced.
<strong>Wildcard</strong> is a wildcard string as defined in
<a href="filelib">filelib</a>,
but not an atom.</p> </dd><dt><strong>rr(WildcardOrModule, RecordNames)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Reads record definitions from files but
discards record names not mentioned in <strong>RecordNames</strong> (a
record name or a list of record names).</p> </dd><dt><strong>rr(WildcardOrModule, RecordNames, Options)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Reads record definitions from files. The compiler
options <strong>{i,Â Dir}</strong>, <strong>{d,Â Macro}</strong>, and
<strong>{d,Â Macro,Â Value}</strong> are recognized and used
for setting up the include path and macro definitions.
To read all record definitions, use
<strong>'_'</strong> as value of <strong>RecordNames</strong>.</p> </dd></dl><h2>Example</h2><p>The following example is a long dialog with the shell. Commands

mode the user can start and stop jobs.</p><p>In this particular case, command <strong>i</strong> ("interrupt")
terminates the looping program, and command <strong>c</strong>

process. This process, together with any local processes that
it spawns, is referred to as a <strong>job</strong>. Only the current job,
which is said to be <strong>connected</strong>, can perform operations
with standard I/O. All other jobs, which are said to be <strong>detached</strong>,
are <strong>blocked</strong> if they attempt to use standard I/O.</p><p>All jobs that do not use standard I/O run in the normal way.</p><p>The shell escape key <strong>^G</strong> (Control G) detaches the current
job and activates <strong>JCL</strong> mode. The <strong>JCL</strong> mode prompt is

message is displayed:</p><pre>

application variable <strong>shell_esc</strong>. The value of
the variable can be either <strong>jcl</strong> (<strong>erl -stdlib shell_esc jcl</strong>) 
or <strong>abort</strong> (<strong>erl -stdlib shell_esc abort</strong>). The 
first option sets <strong>^G</strong> to activate <strong>JCL</strong> mode (which
is also default behavior). The latter sets <strong>^G</strong> to
terminate the current shell and start a new one.
<strong>JCL</strong> mode cannot be invoked when 
<strong>shell_esc</strong> is set to <strong>abort</strong>.</p><p>If you want an Erlang node to have a remote job active from the start
(rather than the default local job), start Erlang with flag
<strong>-remsh</strong>, for example,
<strong>erl -sname this_node -remsh other_node@other_host</strong></p><h2>Restricted Shell</h2><p>The shell can be started in a
restricted mode. In this mode, the shell evaluates a function call
only if allowed. This feature makes it possible to, for example,
prevent a user from accidentally calling a function from the
prompt that could harm a running system (useful in combination
with system flag <strong>+Bi</strong>).</p><p>When the restricted shell evaluates an expression and
encounters a function call or an operator application,
it calls a callback function (with
information about the function call in question). This callback
function returns <strong>true</strong> to let the shell go ahead with the
evaluation, or <strong>false</strong> to abort it. There are two possible
callback functions for the user to implement:</p><ul><li> <p><strong>local_allowed(Func, ArgList, State) -&gt; {boolean(),NewState}</strong></p> <p>This is used to determine if the call to the local function
<strong>Func</strong> with arguments <strong>ArgList</strong> is to be allowed.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>non_local_allowed(FuncSpec, ArgList, State) -&gt; {boolean(),NewState} | {{redirect,NewFuncSpec,NewArgList},NewState}</strong></p> <p>This is used to determine if the call to non-local function
<strong>FuncSpec</strong> (<strong>{Module,Func}</strong> or a fun) with arguments
<strong>ArgList</strong> is to be allowed. The return value
<strong>{redirect,NewFuncSpec,NewArgList}</strong> can be used to let
the shell evaluate some other function than the one specified by
<strong>FuncSpec</strong> and <strong>ArgList</strong>.</p> </li></ul><p>These callback functions are called from local and
non-local evaluation function handlers, described in the
<a href="erl_eval">erl_eval</a> 
manual page. (Arguments in <strong>ArgList</strong> are evaluated before the
callback functions are called.)</p><p>Argument <strong>State</strong> is a tuple
<strong>{ShellState,ExprState}</strong>. The return value <strong>NewState</strong>
has the same form. This can be used to carry a state between calls
to the callback functions. Data saved in <strong>ShellState</strong> lives
through an entire shell session. Data saved in <strong>ExprState</strong>
lives only through the evaluation of the current expression.</p><p>There are two ways to start a restricted shell session:</p><ul><li> <p>Use STDLIB application variable <strong>restricted_shell</strong>
and specify, as its value, the name of the callback
module. Example (with callback functions implemented in
<strong>callback_mod.erl</strong>):
<strong>$ erl -stdlib restricted_shell callback_mod</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p>From a normal shell session, call function
<a href="#start_restricted/1">start_restricted/1</a>. This exits the current evaluator
and starts a new one in restricted mode.</p> </li></ul><p><em>Notes:</em></p><ul><li> <p>When restricted shell mode is activated or
deactivated, new jobs started on the node run in restricted
or normal mode, respectively.</p> </li><li> <p>If restricted mode has been enabled on a
particular node, remote shells connecting to this node also
run in restricted mode.</p> </li><li> <p>The callback functions cannot be used to allow or disallow
execution of functions called from compiled code (only functions
called from expressions entered at the shell prompt).</p> </li></ul><p>Errors when loading the callback module is handled in different
ways depending on how the restricted shell is activated:</p><ul><li> <p>If the restricted shell is activated by setting the STDLIB
variable during emulator startup, and the callback module cannot be
loaded, a default restricted shell allowing only the commands
<strong>q()</strong> and <strong>init:stop()</strong> is used as fallback.</p> </li><li> <p>If the restricted shell is activated using
<a href="#start_restricted/1">start_restricted/1</a> and the callback module cannot
be loaded, an error report is sent to the error logger and the call
returns <strong>{error,Reason}</strong>.</p> </li></ul><h2>Prompting</h2><p>The default shell prompt function displays the name of the node
(if the node can be part of a distributed system) and the
current command number. The user can customize the prompt
function by calling <a href="#prompt_func/1">prompt_func/1</a> or by setting application
configuration parameter <strong>shell_prompt_func</strong> for the
STDLIB application.</p><p>A customized prompt function is stated as a tuple
<strong>{Mod,Â Func}</strong>. The function is called as
<strong>Mod:Func(L)</strong>, where <strong>L</strong> is a list of key-value pairs
created by the shell. Currently there is only one pair:
<strong>{history, N}</strong>, where <strong>N</strong> is the current command number. The
function is to return a list of characters or an atom. This
constraint is because of the Erlang I/O protocol. Unicode characters
beyond code point 255 are allowed in the list and the atom. Notice
that in restricted mode the call <strong>Mod:Func(L)</strong> must be
allowed or the default shell prompt function is called.</p><h1>Functions</h1><h2>catch_exception(Bool) -&gt; boolean()</h2><p>Set the exception handling of the shell.</p><ul><li><span class="v">Bool = boolean()</span></li></ul><p>Sets the exception handling of the evaluator process. The
previous exception handling is returned. The default
(<strong>false</strong>) is to kill the evaluator process when an
exception occurs, which causes the shell to create a new
evaluator process. When the exception handling is set to
<strong>true</strong>, the evaluator process lives on, which means that,
for example, ports and ETS tables as well as processes
linked to the evaluator process survive the exception.</p><h2>history/1</h2><p>Set the number of previous commands to keep.</p><p>Sets the number of previous commands to keep in the
history list to <strong><span class="anno">N</span></strong>. The previous number is
returned. Defaults to 20.</p><h2>prompt_func/1</h2><p>Set the shell prompt.</p><p>Sets the shell prompt function to <strong><span class="anno">PromptFunc</span></strong>.
The previous prompt function is returned.</p><h2>results/1</h2><p>Set the number of previous results to keep.</p><p>Sets the number of results from previous commands to keep in
the history list to <strong><span class="anno">N</span></strong>. The previous number is
returned. Defaults to 20.</p><h2>start_restricted/1</h2><p>Exit a normal shell and starts a restricted shell.</p><p>Exits a normal shell and starts a restricted shell.
<strong><span class="anno">Module</span></strong> specifies the callback module for the
functions <strong>local_allowed/3</strong> and <strong>non_local_allowed/3</strong>.
The function is meant to be called from the shell.</p><p>If the callback module cannot be loaded, an error tuple is
returned. The <strong><span class="anno">Reason</span></strong> in the error tuple is the one
returned by the code loader when trying to load the code of the
callback module.</p><h2>stop_restricted/0</h2><p>Exit a restricted shell and starts a normal shell.</p><p>Exits a restricted shell and starts a normal shell. The function
is meant to be called from the shell.</p><h2>strings/1</h2><p>Set the shell's string recognition flag.</p><p>Sets pretty printing of lists to <strong><span class="anno">Strings</span></strong>.
The previous value of the flag is returned.</p><p>The flag can also be set by the STDLIB application variable
<strong>shell_strings</strong>. Defaults to
<strong>true</strong>, which means that lists of integers are
printed using the string syntax, when possible. Value
<strong>false</strong> means that no lists are printed using the
string syntax.</p></body></html>
