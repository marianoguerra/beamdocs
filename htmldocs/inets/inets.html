application takeover and failover behavior when <strong>Inets</strong> is
run as a distributed application. Nor are they
automatically restarted when the <strong>Inets</strong> application is
restarted. As long as the <strong>Inets</strong> application is operational,
they are supervised and can be soft code upgraded.</p><p>A service started as <strong>stand_alone</strong>, that is, the service 
is not started as part of the <strong>Inets</strong> application, 
lose all OTP application benefits, such as soft upgrade. 
The <strong>stand_alone</strong>-service is linked to
the process that started it. Usually some
supervision functionality is still in place and in
some sense the calling process becomes the top
supervisor.</p></div><a name="stop2"></a><h2>stop() -&gt; ok</h2><p>Stops the <strong>Inets</strong> application.</p><p>Stops the <strong>Inets</strong> application. See also
