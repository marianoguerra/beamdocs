Services can be configured to be started at application startup or
dynamically in runtime. To run <strong>Inets</strong> as a distributed 
application that handles application failover and takeover, 
configure the services to be started at application startup. 
When starting the <strong>Inets</strong> application, the <strong>Inets</strong> 
top supervisor starts a number of subsupervisors and worker 
processes for handling the provided services.
When starting services dynamically, new children are added to the 
supervision tree, unless the service is started with the standalone 
option. In this case the service is linked to the calling process 
and all OTP application features, such as soft upgrade, are lost.</p><p>Services to be configured for startup at application startup are to 
be put into the Erlang node configuration file
on the following form:</p><pre>
      [{inets, [{services, ListofConfiguredServices}]}].</pre><p>For details of what to put in the list of configured services, 
see the documentation for the services to be configured.</p></body></html>
