Erlang/OTP installation and determines various dependencies between
applications. The <strong>graphical</strong> frontend depicts the dependencies and
enables interactive customization of a target system. The backend provides a
<strong>batch</strong> interface for generation of customized target systems.</p><h3>Scope and Purpose</h3><p>This manual describes the Reltool application, as a component of the
Erlang/Open Telecom Platform development environment. It is assumed that
the reader is familiar with the Erlang Development Environment, which is
described in a separate User's Guide.</p><h3>Prerequisites</h3><p>The following prerequisites is required for understanding the material
in the Reltool User's Guide:</p><ul><li> <p>familiarity with Erlang/OTP system principles and Erlang/OTP design
principles</p> </li></ul><p>The application requires Erlang/OTP release R13B02 or later.</p><h3>About This Manual</h3><p>In addition to this introductory chapter, the Reltool User's Guide
contains the following chapters:</p><ul><li> <p>Chapter 2: "Usage" describes the architecture
and typical usage of the application.</p> </li><li> <p>Chapter 3: "Examples" gives some usage examples</p> </li></ul><h3>Where to Find More Information</h3><p>Refer to the following documentation for more information about Reltool
and about the Erlang/OTP development system:</p><ul><li> <p>the Reference Manual of Reltool</p> </li><li> <p>the Erlang/OTP <strong>System Principles</strong></p> </li><li> <p>the Erlang/OTP <strong>Design Principles</strong></p> </li><li> <p>Programming Erlang: Software for a Concurrent World (2007),
Pragmatic Bookshelf, ISBN13: 9781934356005.</p> </li></ul><h3>Overview</h3><p>This document focuses on the graphical parts of the tool. The
concepts are explained in the reference manual for the module
<strong>reltool</strong>.</p><h3>System window</h3><p>The system window is started with the function
<strong>reltool:start/1</strong>. At startup the tool will process all
<strong>beam</strong> files and <strong>app</strong> files in order to find out dependencies
between applications and their modules. Once all this information has been
derived, it will be possible to explore the tool.</p><p>The system window consists of four main pages (tabs):</p><ul><li>Libraries </li><li>System settings </li><li>Applications </li><li>Releases </li></ul><p>Click on a name tag to display its page.</p><h3>Libraries</h3><p>On the library page it is possible to control which sources
the tool will use. The page is organized as a tree which
can be expanded and collapsed by clicking on the little symbol
in the beginning of the expandable/collapsible lines.</p><p>The <strong>Root directory</strong> can be edited by selecting the
line where the path of the root directory is displayed and
clicking the right mouse button. Choose edit in the menu
that pops up.</p><p>Library directories can be added, edited or deleted. This
is done by selecting the line where the path to a library
directory is displayed and clicking the right mouse
button. Choose add, edit or delete in the menu that pops
up. New library directories can also be added by selecting the
line <strong>Library directories</strong> and clicking the right
mouse button. Choose add in the menu that pops up.</p><p>Escript files can be added, edited or deleted. This is done
by selecting the line where the path to an escript file is
displayed and clicking the right mouse button. Choose
add, edit or delete in the menu that pops up. New escripts can
also be added by selecting the line <strong>Escript files</strong> and
clicking the right mouse button. Choose add in the menu
that pops up.</p><p>When libraries and escripts are expanded, the names of
their contained applications will be displayed. Double click
on an application name to launch an application window.</p><h3>System settings</h3><p>On the system settings page it is possible to control some
global settings that are used as defaults for all
applications. Set the <strong>Application inclusion policy</strong> to
<strong>include</strong> to include all applications that are not
explicitly excluded. See <strong>incl_cond</strong> (application
inclusion) and <strong>mod_cond</strong> (module inclusion) in the
reference manual for the module <strong>reltool</strong> for more
info.</p><p>The system settings page is rather incomplete.</p><h3>Applications</h3><p>There are four categories of applications on the
applications page. <strong>Included</strong> contains applications that
are explicitly included. <strong>Excluded</strong> contains applications
that are explicitly excluded. <strong>Derived</strong> contains
applications that either are used directly by explicitly
included applications or by other derived
applications. <strong>Available</strong> contains the remaining
applications.</p><p>Select one or more applications and click on a button
directly below the application column to change application
category. For example, select an available application and
click on its tick button to move the application to the
included category.  Clicking on the tick symbol for included
applications will move the application back to the available
category. The tick is undone.</p><p>The symbols in front of the application names are intended
to describe the status of the application. There are error
and warning symbols to signalize that there is
something which needs attention. The tick symbol means that the
application is included or derived and no problem has been
detected. The cross symbol means that the application is
excluded or available and no problem has been
detected. Applications with error symbols are listed first in
each category and are followed by the warnings and the
normal ones (ticks and crosses) at the end.</p><p>Double click on an application to launch its application
window.</p><h3>Releases</h3><p>The releases page is incomplete and very experimental.</p><h3>File menu</h3><ul><li> <p><strong>Display application dependency graph</strong> - Launches an
application force graph window. All included and derived
applications and their dependencies will be shown in a
graph.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>Display module dependency graph</strong> - Launch a module
force graph window. All included and derived modules and
their dependencies will be shown in a graph.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>Reset configuration to default</strong></p> </li><li> <p><strong>Undo configuration (toggle)</strong></p> </li><li> <p><strong>Load configuration</strong> - Loads a new configuration from file.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>Save configuration</strong> - Saves the current
configuration to file. Normally, only the explicit
configuration parameters with values that differ from their
defaults are saved. But the configuration with or without
default values and with or without derived values may also
be saved.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>Generate rel, script and boot files</strong></p> </li><li> <p><strong>Generate target system</strong></p> </li><li> <p><strong>Close</strong> - Close the system window and all its subwindows.</p> </li></ul><h3>Dependencies between applications or modules displayed as a graph</h3><p>The dependency graph windows are launched from the file menu
in the system window. The graph depicts all included and derived
applications/modules and their dependencies.</p><p>It is possible to perform some limited manipulations of the
graph. Nodes can be moved, selected, locked or deleted. Move a
single node or the entire graph by moving the mouse while the
left mouse button is pressed. A node can be locked into a fix
position by holding down the shift button when the left mouse
button is released. Select several nodes by moving the mouse
while the control key and the left mouse button are
pressed. Selected nodes can be locked, unlocked or deleted by
clicking on a suitable button.</p><p>The algorithm that is used to draw a graph with as few
crossed links as possible is called force graph. A force graph
consists of nodes and directed links between nodes. Each node is
associated with a repulsive force that pushes nodes away from
each other. This force can be adjusted with the left slider or
with the mouse wheel. Each link is associated with an attractive
force that pulls the nodes nearer to each other. This force can be
adjusted with the right slider. If this force becomes too strong,
the graph will be unstable. The third parameter that can be
adjusted is the length of the links. It is adjusted with the
middle slider.</p><p>The <strong>Freeze</strong> button starts/stops the redrawing of the
graph. <strong>Reset</strong> moves the graph to the middle of the window
and resets all graph settings to default, with the exception of
deleted nodes.</p><h3>Application window</h3><p>The application window is started by double clicking on an
application name. The application window consists of four
pages (tabs):</p><ul><li>Application settings </li><li>Modules </li><li>Application dependencies </li><li>Module dependencies </li></ul><p>Click on a name tag to display its page.</p><h3>Application settings</h3><p>Select version of the application in the <strong>Source selection policy</strong> part of the page. By default the latest version of the
application is selected, but it is possible to override this by
explicitly selecting another version.</p><p>Note that in order for reltool to sort application versions and
thereby be able to select the latest, it is required that the
version id for the application consits of integers and dots only,
for example <strong>1</strong>, <strong>2.0</strong> or <strong>3.17.1</strong>.</p><p>By default the <strong>Application inclusion policy</strong> on system
level is used for all applications. Set the value to
<strong>include</strong> if you want to explicitly include one particular
application. Set it to <strong>exclude</strong> if you want to exclude the
application despite that it is used by another (explicitly or
implicitly) included application. <strong>derived</strong> means that the
application automatically will be included if some other
(explicitly or implicitly) included application uses it.</p><p>By default the <strong>Module inclusion policy</strong> on system level
is used for all applications. Set it to <strong>derived</strong> if you only
want actually used modules to be included. Set it to <strong>app</strong> if
you, besides derived modules, also want the modules listed in the
app file to be included. Set it to <strong>ebin</strong> if you, besides
derived modules, also want the modules that exist as beam files
in the ebin directory to be included. Set it to <strong>all</strong> if you
want all modules to be included, that is the union of modules
found in the ebin directory and listed in the app file.</p><p>The application settings page is rather incomplete.</p><h3>Modules</h3><p>There are four categories of modules on the modules
page. <strong>Included</strong> contains modules that are explicitly
included. <strong>Excluded</strong> contains modules that are explicitly
excluded. <strong>Derived</strong> contains modules that either are used
directly by explicitly included modules or by other derived
modules. <strong>Available</strong> contains the remaining modules.</p><p>Select one or more modules and click on a button directly
below the module column to change module category. For
example, select an available module and click on its tick
button to move the module to the included category.  Clicking
on the tick symbol for included modules will move the
module back to the available category. The tick is
undone.</p><p>The symbols in front of the module names are intended to
describe the status of the module. There are error and
and warning symbols to signalize that there is something that needs
attention. The tick symbol means that the module is included
or derived and no problem has been detected. The cross symbol
means that the module is excluded or available and no problem
has been detected. Modules with error symbols are listed
first in each category and are followed by warnings and the
normal ones (ticks and crosses) at the end.</p><p>Double click on a module to launch its module window.</p><h3>Application dependencies</h3><p>There are four categories of applications on the <strong>Application dependencies</strong> page. If the application is used by other
applications, these are listed under <strong>Used by</strong>. If the
application requires other applications be started before it can
be started, these are listed under <strong>Required</strong>. These
applications are listed in the <strong>applications</strong> part of the
<strong>app</strong> file. If the application includes other applications,
these are listed under <strong>Included</strong>. These applications are
listed in the <strong>included_applications</strong> part of the <strong>app</strong>
file.  If the application uses other applications, these
are listed under <strong>Uses</strong>.</p><p>Double click on an application name to launch an application window.</p><h3>Module dependencies</h3><p>There are two categories of modules on the <strong>Module dependencies</strong> page. If the module is used by other modules,
these are listed under <strong>Modules using this</strong>. If the
module uses other modules, these are listed under <strong>Used modules</strong>.</p><p>Double click on an module name to launch a module window.</p><h3>Module window</h3><p>The module window is started by double clicking on an module
name. The module window consists initially of two pages (tabs):</p><ul><li>Dependencies </li><li>Code </li></ul><p>Click on a name tag to display its page.</p><h3>Dependencies</h3><p>There are two categories of modules on the <strong>Dependencies</strong>
page. If the module is used by other modules, these are listed
under <strong>Modules using this</strong>. If the module uses other
modules, these are listed under <strong>Used modules</strong>.</p><p>Double click on an module name to launch a module window.</p><h3>Code</h3><p>On the <strong>Code</strong> page the Erlang source code is displayed. It
is possible to search forwards and backwards for text in the
module. Enter a regular expression in the <strong>Find</strong> field and
press enter. It is also possible to go to a certain line in the
module. The <strong>Back</strong> button can be used to go back to the
previous position.</p><p>Put the marker on a function name and double click to go to the
definition of the function. If the function is defined in another
module, that module will be loaded and added to the page list.
</p><h3>Start and stop windows and servers</h3><p>The main process in Reltool is the server. It can be used as it
is or be used via the GUI frontend process. When the GUI is
started, a server process will automatically be started. The GUI
process is started with
<a href="./reltool#start-0">reltool#start-0</a>,
<a href="./reltool#start-1">reltool#start-1</a> or
<a href="./reltool#start_link-1">reltool#start_link-1</a>.
The pid of its server can be obtained with
<a href="./reltool#start_link-1">reltool#start_link-1</a>
