testing. It is suitable for:</p><ul><li><p>Black-box testing of target systems of any type (that
is, not necessarily implemented in Erlang). This is performed
through standard O&amp;M interfaces (such as SNMP, HTTP, CORBA,
and Telnet) and, if necessary, through user-specific interfaces
(often called test ports).</p></li><li><p>White-box testing of Erlang/OTP programs. This is easily
done by calling the target API functions directly from the test
case functions.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Common Test</strong> also integrates use of the OTP
<a href="./cover">cover</a> tool in application 
Tools for code coverage analysis of Erlang/OTP programs.</p><p><strong>Common Test</strong> executes test suite programs automatically,
without operator interaction. Test progress and results are
printed to logs in HTML format, easily browsed with a standard
web browser. <strong>Common Test</strong> also sends notifications about progress
and results through an OTP event manager to event handlers plugged
in to the system. This way, users can integrate their own
programs for, for example, logging, database storing, or supervision with
<strong>Common Test</strong>.</p><p><strong>Common Test</strong> provides libraries with useful support 
functions to fill various testing needs and requirements. 
There is, for example, support for flexible test declarations 
through test specifications. There is also support 
for central configuration and control of multiple 
independent test sessions (to different target systems)
running in parallel.</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the Erlang
programming language.</p></body></html>
