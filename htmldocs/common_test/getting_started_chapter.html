The purpose of this section is to let the newcomer get started in
quickly writing and executing some first simple tests with a 
"learning by example" approach. Most explanations are left for later sections. 
If you are not much into "learning by example" and prefer more technical
details, go ahead and skip to the next section.
</p><p>
This section demonstrates how simple it is to write a basic 
(yet for many module testing purposes, often sufficiently complex) 
test suite and execute its test cases. This is not necessarily
obvious when you read the remaining sections in this User's Guide.
</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>
To understand what is discussed and examplified here, we recommended 
you to first read section
<a href="./basics_chapter#basics">Common Test Basics</a>.
</p></div><h2>Test Case Execution</h2><p>Execution of test cases is handled as follows:</p><img src="tc_execution.gif" title="
	Successful and Unsuccessful Test Case Execution
"></img><p>For each test case that <strong>Common Test</strong> is ordered to execute, it spawns a
dedicated process on which the test case function starts
running. (In parallel to the test case process, an idle waiting timer
process is started, which is linked to the test case process. If the timer
process runs out of waiting time, it sends an exit signal to terminate
the test case process. This is called a <em>timetrap</em>).
</p><p>In scenario 1, the test case process terminates normally after 
<strong>case A</strong> has finished executing its test code without detecting 
any errors. The test case function returns a value and <strong>Common Test</strong> 
logs the test case as successful.
</p><p>In scenario 2, an error is detected during test <strong>case B</strong> execution.
This causes the test <strong>case B</strong> function to generate an exception
and, as a result, the test case process exits with reason other than normal. 
<strong>Common Test</strong> logs this as an unsuccessful (Failed) test case.
</p><p>As you can understand from the illustration, <strong>Common Test</strong> requires
a test case to generate a runtime error to indicate failure (for example,
by causing a bad match error or by calling <strong>exit/1</strong>, preferably
through the help function 
<a href="./ct#fail-1">ct#fail-1</a>). A successful 
execution is indicated by a normal return from the test case function.
</p><h2>A Simple Test Suite</h2><p>As shown in section 
<a href="./basics_chapter#External_Interfaces">Common Test Basics</a>,
the test suite module implements
<a href="common_test">callback functions</a>
(mandatory or optional) for various purposes, for example:
</p><ul><li>Init/end configuration function for the test suite</li><li>Init/end configuration function for a test case</li><li>Init/end configuration function for a test case group</li><li>Test cases</li></ul><p> 
The configuration functions are optional. The following example is a test suite 
without configuration functions, including one simple test case, to 
check that module <strong>mymod</strong> exists (that is, can be successfully loaded by the 
code server):
</p><pre>
 -module(my1st_SUITE).
 -compile(export_all).

 all() -&gt;
     [mod_exists].

 mod_exists(_) -&gt;
     {module,mymod} = code:load_file(mymod).</pre><p>
If the operation fails, a bad match error occurs that terminates the test case.
</p><h2>A Test Suite with Configuration Functions</h2><p>
If you need to perform configuration operations to run your test, you can
implement configuration functions in your suite. The result from a
configuration function is configuration data, or <strong>Config</strong>.
This is a list of key-value tuples that get passed from the configuration
function to the test cases (possibly through configuration functions on
"lower level"). The data flow looks as follows:
</p><img src="config.gif" title="
	Configuration Data Flow in a Suite
"></img><p>
The following example shows a test suite that uses configuration functions
to open and close a log file for the test cases (an operation that is
unnecessary and irrelevant to perform by each test case):
</p><pre>
 -module(check_log_SUITE).
 -export([all/0, init_per_suite/1, end_per_suite/1]).
 -export([check_restart_result/1, check_no_errors/1]).

 -define(value(Key,Config), proplists:get_value(Key,Config)).

 all() -&gt; [check_restart_result, check_no_errors].

 init_per_suite(InitConfigData) -&gt;
     [{logref,open_log()} | InitConfigData].

 end_per_suite(ConfigData) -&gt;
     close_log(?value(logref, ConfigData)).

 check_restart_result(ConfigData) -&gt;
     TestData = read_log(restart, ?value(logref, ConfigData)),
     {match,_Line} = search_for("restart successful", TestData).

 check_no_errors(ConfigData) -&gt;
     TestData = read_log(all, ?value(logref, ConfigData)),
     case search_for("error", TestData) of
	 {match,Line} -&gt; ct:fail({error_found_in_log,Line});
	 nomatch -&gt; ok
     end.</pre><p>
The test cases verify, by parsing a log file, that our SUT has performed 
a successful restart and that no unexpected errors are printed.
</p><p>To execute the test cases in the recent test suite, type the 
following on the UNIX/Linux command line (assuming that the suite module
is in the current working directory):
</p><pre>
 $ ct_run -dir .</pre><p>or:</p><pre>
 $ ct_run -suite check_log_SUITE</pre><p>To use the Erlang shell to run our test, you can evaluate the following call:
</p><pre>
 1&gt; ct:run_test([{dir, "."}]).</pre><p>or:</p><pre>
 1&gt; ct:run_test([{suite, "check_log_SUITE"}]).</pre><p>
The result from running the test is printed in log files in HTML format
(stored in unique log directories on a different level). The following 
illustration shows the log file structure:

with corresponding tips and links to the answers:
</p><ul><li><p><em>Question:</em> 
"How and where can I specify variable data for my tests that must not 
be hard-coded in the test suites (such as hostnames, addresses, and
user login data)?"</p> <p><em>Answer:</em> 
See section <a href="./config_file_chapter#top">External Configuration Data</a>.</p> </li><li><p><em>Question:</em> "Is there a way to declare different tests and run them

at the same time digging deeper into the <strong>Common Test</strong> User's Guide and Reference Manual.
There are much more to learn about the things that have been introduced
