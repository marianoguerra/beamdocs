consists of test cases, configuration functions, and information 
functions. Test cases can be grouped in so called test case groups. 
A test suite is an Erlang module and test cases are implemented as 
Erlang functions. Test suites are stored in test directories.</p><a name="skipping_test_cases"></a><h2>Skipping Test Cases</h2><p>Certain test cases can be skipped, for example, if you
know beforehand that a specific test case fails. The reason can be
functionality that is not yet implemented, a bug that is known but
not yet fixed, or some functionality that does not work or is not
applicable on a specific platform.</p><p>Test cases can be skipped in the following ways:</p><ul><li>Using <strong>skip_suites</strong> and <strong>skip_cases</strong> terms in  <a href="./run_test_chapter#test_specifications">test specifications</a>. </li><li>Returning <strong>{skip,Reason}</strong> from function <a href="./common_test#Module:init_per_testcase-2">common_test#Module:init_per_testcase-2</a> or  <a href="./common_test#Module:init_per_suite-1">common_test#Module:init_per_suite-1</a>.</li><li>Returning <strong>{skip,Reason}</strong> from the execution clause of the test case. The execution clause is called, so the author  must ensure that the test case does not run.</li></ul><p>When a test case is skipped, it is noted as <strong>SKIPPED</strong>
in the HTML log.</p><h2>Definition of Terms</h2><dl><dt><em>Auto-skipped test case</em></dt><dd> <p>When a configuration function fails (that is, terminates unexpectedly), 
the test cases depending on the configuration function are
skipped automatically by <strong>Common Test</strong>. The status of the test cases 
is then "auto-skipped".	Test cases are also "auto-skipped" by
<strong>Common Test</strong> if the required configuration data is unavailable at
runtime.</p> </dd><dt><em>Configuration function</em></dt><dd> <p>A function in a test suite that is meant to be used for
setting up, cleaning up, and/or verifying the state and 
environment on the System Under Test (SUT) and/or the <strong>Common Test</strong> 
host node, so that a test case (or a set of test cases) can 
execute correctly.</p>      </dd><dt><em>Configuration file</em></dt><dd> <p>A file containing data related to a test and/or an SUT,
for example, protocol server addresses, client
login details, and hardware interface addresses. That is, any data
that is to be handled as variable in the suite and not
be hard-coded.</p>    </dd><dt><em>Configuration variable</em></dt><dd> <p>A name (an Erlang atom) associated with a data value read from
a configuration file.</p> </dd><dt><strong>data_dir</strong></dt><dd> <p>Data directory for a test suite. This directory contains
any files used by the test suite, for example, extra Erlang
modules, binaries, or data files.</p> </dd><dt><em>Information function</em></dt><dd> <p>A function in a test suite that returns a list of properties
(read by the <strong>Common Test</strong> server) that describes the conditions 
for executing the test cases in the suite.</p> </dd><dt><em>Major log file</em></dt><dd> <p>An overview and summary log file for one or more test suites.</p> </dd><dt><em>Minor log file</em></dt><dd> <p>A log file for one particular test case. Also called the 
test case log file.</p> </dd><dt><strong>priv_dir</strong></dt><dd> <p>Private directory for a test suite. This directory is to
be used when the test suite needs to write to files.</p> </dd><dt><strong>ct_run</strong></dt><dd> <p>The name of an executable program that can be
used as an interface for specifying and running
tests with <strong>Common Test</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><em>Test case</em></dt><dd> <p>A single test included in a test suite. A test case is
implemented as a function in a test suite module.</p> </dd><dt><em>Test case group</em></dt><dd> <p>A set of test cases sharing configuration functions and 
execution properties. The execution properties specify if 
the test cases in the group are to be executed in random order,
in parallel, or in sequence, and if the execution of the group 
is be repeated. Test case groups can also be nested. That is, 
a group can, besides test cases, contain subgroups.</p> </dd><dt><em>Test suite</em></dt><dd> <p>An Erlang module containing a collection of test cases for
a specific functional area.</p> </dd><dt><em>Test directory</em></dt><dd> <p>A directory containing one or more test suite modules,
that is, a group of test suites.</p> </dd><dt><em>Argument</em> <strong>Config</strong></dt><dd> <p>A list of key-value tuples (that is, a property list) containing
runtime configuration data passed from the configuration
functions to the test cases.</p> </dd><dt><em>User-skipped test case</em></dt><dd> <p>The status of a test case explicitly skipped in any of 
the ways described in section
<a href="#skipping_test_cases">Skipping Test Cases</a>.
