operator interface for testing, providing the following features:</p><ul><li>Automatic compilation of test suites (and help modules)</li><li>Creation of extra HTML pages for improved overview.</li><li>Single-command interface for running all available tests</li><li>Handling of configuration files specifying data related to the System Under Test (SUT) (and any other variable data)</li><li>Mode for running multiple independent test sessions in parallel with central control and configuration</li></ul><h2>Automatic Compilation of Test Suites and Help Modules</h2><p>When <strong>Common Test</strong> starts, it automatically attempts to compile any
suites included in the specified tests. If particular
suites are specified, only those suites are compiled. If a
particular test object directory is specified (meaning all suites
in this directory are to be part of the test), <strong>Common Test</strong> runs
function <strong>make:all/1</strong> in the directory to compile the suites.</p><p>If compilation fails for one or more suites, the compilation errors
are printed to tty and the operator is asked if the test run is to proceed
without the missing suites, or be aborted. If the operator chooses to proceed, 
the tests having missing suites are noted in the HTML log. If <strong>Common Test</strong> is
unable to prompt the user after compilation failure (if <strong>Common Test</strong> does not
control <strong>stdin</strong>), the test run proceeds automatically without the missing
suites. This behavior can however be modified with the
<strong>ct_run</strong> flag <strong>-abort_if_missing_suites</strong>, 
or the <a href="./ct#run_test-1">ct#run_test-1</a> option
<strong>{abort_if_missing_suites,TrueOrFalse}</strong>. If 
<strong>abort_if_missing_suites</strong> is set to <strong>true</strong>, the test run
stops immediately if some suites fail to compile.</p><p>Any help module (that is, regular Erlang module with name not ending with
"_SUITE") that resides in the same test object directory as a suite, 
which is part of the test, is also automatically compiled. A help
module is not mistaken for a test suite (unless it has a "_SUITE" name).
All help modules in a particular test object directory
are compiled, no matter if all or only particular suites in the directory 
are part of the test.</p><p>If test suites or help modules include header files stored in other
locations than the test directory, these include directories can be specified
by using flag <strong>-include</strong> with 
<a href="ct_run">ct_run</a>, 
or option <strong>include</strong> with <strong>ct:run_test/1</strong>.
Also, an include path can be specified with an OS
environment variable, <strong>CT_INCLUDE_PATH</strong>.</p><p><em>Example (bash):</em></p><p><strong>$ export CT_INCLUDE_PATH=~testuser/common_suite_files/include:~testuser/common_lib_files/include</strong></p><p><strong>Common Test</strong> passes all include directories (specified either with flag/option
<strong>include</strong>, or variable <strong>CT_INCLUDE_PATH</strong>
, or both, to the compiler.</p><p>Include directories can also be specified in test specifications,
see <a href="#test_specifications">Test Specifications</a>.</p><p>If the user wants to run all test suites for a test object (or an OTP application)
by specifying only the top directory (for example, with start flag/option <strong>dir</strong>),
<strong>Common Test</strong> primarily looks for test suite modules in a subdirectory named 
<strong>test</strong>. If this subdirectory does not exist, the specified top directory
is assumed to be the test directory, and test suites are read from
there instead.</p><p>To disable the automatic compilation feature, use flag
<strong>-no_auto_compile</strong> with <strong>ct_run</strong>, or
option <strong>{auto_compile,false}</strong> with 
<strong>ct:run_test/1</strong>. With automatic compilation
disabled, the user is responsible for compiling the test suite modules 
(and any help modules) before the test run. If the modules cannot be loaded
from the local file system during startup of <strong>Common Test</strong>, the user must
preload the modules before starting the test. <strong>Common Test</strong> only verifies
that the specified test suites exist (that is, that they are, or can be, loaded).
This is useful, for example, if the test suites are transferred and loaded as 
binaries through RPC from a remote node.</p><a name="ct_run"></a><h2>Running Tests from the OS Command Line</h2><p>The <a href="ct_run">ct_run</a> program can be used 
for running tests from the OS command line, for example, as follows:
</p><ul><li><strong>ct_run -config &lt;configfilenames&gt; -dir &lt;dirs&gt;</strong></li><li><strong>ct_run -config &lt;configfilenames&gt; -suite &lt;suiteswithfullpath&gt;</strong> </li><li><strong>ct_run -userconfig &lt;callbackmodulename&gt; &lt;configfilenames&gt; -suite &lt;suiteswithfullpath&gt;</strong> </li><li><strong>ct_run -config &lt;configfilenames&gt; -suite &lt;suitewithfullpath&gt; -group &lt;groups&gt; -case &lt;casenames&gt;</strong></li></ul><p><em>Examples:</em></p><pre>
 $ ct_run -config $CFGS/sys1.cfg $CFGS/sys2.cfg -dir $SYS1_TEST $SYS2_TEST
 $ ct_run -userconfig ct_config_xml $CFGS/sys1.xml $CFGS/sys2.xml -dir $SYS1_TEST $SYS2_TEST
 $ ct_run -suite $SYS1_TEST/setup_SUITE $SYS2_TEST/config_SUITE
 $ ct_run -suite $SYS1_TEST/setup_SUITE -case start stop
 $ ct_run -suite $SYS1_TEST/setup_SUITE -group installation -case start stop</pre><p>The flags <strong>dir</strong>, <strong>suite</strong>, and <strong>group/case</strong> can be combined.
For example, to run <strong>x_SUITE</strong> and <strong>y_SUITE</strong> 
in directory <strong>testdir</strong>, as follows:</p><pre>
 $ ct_run -dir ./testdir -suite x_SUITE y_SUITE</pre><p>This has the same effect as the following:</p><pre>
 $ ct_run -suite ./testdir/x_SUITE ./testdir/y_SUITE</pre><p>For details, see

parameters to <strong>ct_run</strong>. It is, for example, useful to be able to
pass directories to be added to the Erlang code server search path
with flag <strong>-pa</strong> or <strong>-pz</strong>. If you have common help- or library 
modules for test suites (separately compiled), stored in other directories 
than the test suite directories, these <strong>help/lib</strong> directories are preferably
added to the code path this way.</p><p><em>Example:</em></p><p><strong>$ ct_run -dir ./chat_server -logdir ./chat_server/testlogs -pa $PWD/chat_server/ebin</strong></p><p>The absolute path of directory <strong>chat_server/ebin</strong>
is here passed to the code server. This is essential because relative
paths are stored by the code server as relative, and <strong>Common Test</strong> changes 
the current working directory of ERTS during the test run.</p></div><p>The <strong>ct_run</strong> program sets the exit status before shutting down. The following values
are defined:</p><ul><li><strong>0</strong> indicates a successful testrun, that is, without failed or auto-skipped test cases.</li><li><strong>1</strong> indicates that one or more test cases have failed, or have been auto-skipped.</li><li><strong>2</strong> indicates that the test execution has failed because of, for example, compilation errors, or an illegal return value from an information function.</li></ul><p>If auto-skipped test cases do not affect the exit status. The default
behavior can be changed using start flag:</p><pre>
 -exit_status ignore_config</pre><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>Executing <strong>ct_run</strong> without start flags is equal to the command:
<strong>ct_run -dir ./</strong></p></div><p>For more information about the <strong>ct_run</strong> program, see module
<a href="ct_run">ct_run</a> and section
<a href="./install_chapter#general">Installation</a>.
</p><a name="erlang_shell_or_program"></a><h2>Running Tests from the Erlang Shell or from an Erlang Program</h2><p><strong>Common Test</strong> provides an Erlang API for running tests. The main 
(and most flexible) function for specifying and executing tests is
<a href="./ct#run_test-1">ct#run_test-1</a>.
It takes the same start parameters as
<a href="./run_test_chapter#ct_run">run_test_chapter#ct_run</a>,
but the flags are instead specified as options in a list of key-value tuples. 
For example, a test specified with <strong>ct_run</strong> as follows:</p><p><strong>$ ct_run -suite ./my_SUITE -logdir ./results</strong></p><p>is with <a href="./ct#run_test-1">ct#run_test-1</a> specified as:</p><p><strong>1&gt; ct:run_test([{suite,"./my_SUITE"},{logdir,"./results"}]).</strong></p><p>The function returns the test result, represented by the tuple
<strong>{Ok,Failed,{UserSkipped,AutoSkipped}}</strong>, where each element is an
integer. If test execution fails, the function returns the tuple
<strong>{error,Reason}</strong>, where the term <strong>Reason</strong> explains the
failure.</p><p>The default start option <strong>{dir,Cwd}</strong> (to run all suites in the current
working directory) is used if the function is called with an empty
list of options.</p><h2>Releasing the Erlang Shell</h2><p>During execution of tests started with
<a href="./ct#run_test-1">ct#run_test-1</a>,
the Erlang shell process, controlling <strong>stdin</strong>, remains the top-level
process of the <strong>Common Test</strong> system of processes. Consequently,
the Erlang shell is not available for interaction during
the test run. If this is not desirable, for example, because the shell 
is needed for debugging purposes or for interaction with the SUT during test
execution, set start option <strong>release_shell</strong> to
<strong>true</strong> (in the call to <strong>ct:run_test/1</strong> or by
using the corresponding test specification term, described later). This
makes <strong>Common Test</strong> release the shell immediately after the test suite
compilation stage. To accomplish this, a test runner process
is spawned to take control of the test execution. The effect is that
<strong>ct:run_test/1</strong> returns the pid of this process rather than the
test result, which instead is printed to tty at the end of the test run.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>To use the functions
<a href="./ct#break-1">ct#break-1</a> and
<a href="./ct#continue-0">ct#continue-0</a>,
<strong>release_shell</strong> <em>must</em> be set to <strong>true</strong>.</p></div><p>For details, see
<a href="./ct#run_test-1">ct#run_test-1</a> manual page.</p><a name="group_execution"></a><h2>Test Case Group Execution</h2><p>With the <strong>ct_run</strong> flag, or <strong>ct:run_test/1</strong> option <strong>group</strong>,
one or more test case groups can be specified, optionally in combination
with specific test cases. The syntax for specifying groups on the command line
is as follows:</p><pre>
 $ ct_run -group &lt;group_names_or_paths&gt; [-case &lt;cases&gt;]</pre><p>The syntax in the Erlang shell is as follows:</p><pre>
 1&gt; ct:run_test([{group,GroupsNamesOrPaths}, {case,Cases}]).</pre><p>Parameter <strong>group_names_or_paths</strong> specifies one
or more group names and/or one or more group paths. At startup,
<strong>Common Test</strong> searches for matching groups in the group definitions
tree (that is, the list returned from <strong>Suite:groups/0</strong>; for details, see section
<a href="./write_test_chapter#test_case_groups">Test Case Groups</a>.
</p><p>Given a group name, say <strong>g</strong>, <strong>Common Test</strong> searches for all paths
leading to <strong>g</strong>. By path is meant a sequence of nested groups,
which must be followed to get from the top-level
group to <strong>g</strong>. To execute the test cases in group <strong>g</strong>, 
<strong>Common Test</strong> must call the <strong>init_per_group/2</strong> function for 
each group in the path to <strong>g</strong>, and all corresponding <strong>end_per_group/2</strong>
functions afterwards. This is because the configuration
of a test case in <strong>g</strong> (and its <strong>Config</strong> input data) depends on
<strong>init_per_testcase(TestCase, Config)</strong> and its return value, which
in turn depends on <strong>init_per_group(g, Config)</strong> and its return value,
which in turn depends on <strong>init_per_group/2</strong> of the group above
<strong>g</strong>, and so on, all the way up to the top-level group.</p><p>This means that if there is more than one way to locate a group 
(and its test cases) in a path, the result of the group search operation 
is a number of tests, all of which are to be performed.
<strong>Common Test</strong> interprets a group specification that consists of a
single name as follows:</p><p>"Search and find all paths in the group definitions tree that lead
to the specified group and, for each path, create a test that does the following, 
in order:</p><ul><li>Executes all configuration functions in the path to the specified group.</li><li>Executes all, or all matching, test cases in this group.</li><li>Executes all, or all matching, test cases in all subgroups of the group."</li></ul><p>The user can specify a specific group path with
parameter <strong>group_names_or_paths</strong>. With this type of specification
execution of unwanted groups (in otherwise matching paths),
and/or the execution of subgroups can be avoided. The command line syntax of the 
group path is a list of group names in the path, for example:
</p><p><strong>$ ct_run -suite "./x_SUITE" -group [g1,g3,g4] -case tc1 tc5</strong></p><p>The syntax in the Erlang shell is as follows (requires a list within the groups list):</p><p><strong>1&gt; ct:run_test([{suite,"./x_SUITE"}, {group,[[g1,g3,g4]]}, {testcase,[tc1,tc5]}]).</strong></p><p>The last group in the specified path is the terminating group in
the test, that is, no subgroups following this group are executed. In the
previous example, <strong>g4</strong> is the terminating group. Hence, <strong>Common Test</strong>
executes a test that calls all <strong>init</strong> configuration functions in the path to
<strong>g4</strong>, that is, <strong>g1..g3..g4</strong>. It then calls test cases <strong>tc1</strong>
and <strong>tc5</strong> in <strong>g4</strong>, and finally all <strong>end</strong> configuration functions 
in order <strong>g4..g3..g1</strong>.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>The group path specification does not necessarily
have to include <em>all</em> groups in the path to the terminating group.
<strong>Common Test</strong> searches for all matching paths if an incomplete 
group path is specified.</p></div><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>Group names and group paths can be combined with parameter
<strong>group_names_or_paths</strong>. Each element is treated as an individual specification

be used in <a href="./run_test_chapter#test_specifications">Test Specifications</a> (with some extra features added).</p><h2>Running the Interactive Shell Mode</h2><p>You can start <strong>Common Test</strong> in an interactive shell mode where no
automatic testing is performed. Instead, <strong>Common Test</strong>
starts its utility processes, installs configuration data (if any),
and waits for the user to call functions (typically test case support
functions) from the Erlang shell.</p><p>The shell mode is useful, for example, for debugging test suites, analyzing
and debugging the SUT during "simulated" test case execution, and 
trying out various operations during test suite development.</p><p>To start the interactive shell mode, start an Erlang shell 
manually and call <a href="./ct#install-1">ct#install-1</a> 
to install any configuration data you might need (use <strong>[]</strong> as argument otherwise). 
Then call <a href="./ct#start_interactive-0">ct#start_interactive-0</a> 
to start <strong>Common Test</strong>.</p><p>If you use the <strong>ct_run</strong> program, you can start 
the Erlang shell and <strong>Common Test</strong> in one go by using the flag <strong>-shell</strong> and, 
optionally, flag <strong>-config</strong> and/or <strong>-userconfig</strong>.</p><p><em>Examples:</em></p><ul><li><strong>ct_run -shell</strong></li><li><strong>ct_run -shell -config cfg/db.cfg</strong></li><li><strong>ct_run -shell -userconfig db_login testuser x523qZ</strong></li></ul><p>If no configuration file is specified with command <strong>ct_run</strong>,
a warning is displayed. If <strong>Common Test</strong> has been run from the same
directory earlier, the same configuration file(s) are used again. If <strong>Common Test</strong> 
has not been run from this directory before, no configuration files are available.</p><p>If any functions using "required configuration data" (for example, functions 
<strong>ct_telnet</strong> or <strong>ct_ftp</strong>) are to be called from the Erlang shell, first require 
configuration data with <a href="./ct#require-1">ct#require-1</a>. This is equivalent to a <strong>require</strong> statement 
in the <a href="./write_test_chapter#suite">Test Suite Information Function</a> 
or in the <a href="./write_test_chapter#info_function">Test Case Information Function</a>.</p><p><em>Example:</em></p><pre> 
 1&gt; ct:require(unix_telnet, unix).
 ok
 2&gt; ct_telnet:open(unix_telnet).
 {ok,&lt;0.105.0&gt;}
 4&gt; ct_telnet:cmd(unix_telnet, "ls .").
 {ok,["ls .","file1  ...",...]}</pre><p>Everything that <strong>Common Test</strong> normally prints in the test case logs,
are in the interactive mode written to a log named <strong>ctlog.html</strong> 
in directory  <strong>ct_run.&lt;timestamp&gt;</strong>. A link to this 
file is available in the file named <strong>last_interactive.html</strong> in the 
directory from which you execute <strong>ct_run</strong>. Specifying a different
root directory for the logs than the current working directory
is not supported.</p><p>If you wish to exit the interactive mode (for example, to start an automated 
test run with <a href="./ct#run_test-1">ct#run_test-1</a>), 
call function
<a href="./ct#stop_interactive-0">ct#stop_interactive-0</a>. 
This shuts down the running <strong>ct</strong> application. Associations between
configuration names and data created with <strong>require</strong> are 
consequently deleted. Function
<a href="./ct#start_interactive-0">ct#start_interactive-0</a> 
takes you back into interactive mode, but the previous state is not restored.</p><h2>Step-by-Step Execution of Test Cases with the Erlang Debugger</h2><p>Using <strong>ct_run -step [opts]</strong>, or by passing option <strong>{step,Opts}</strong> 
to <a href="./ct#run_test-1">ct#run_test-1</a>, 
the following is possible:</p><ul><li>Get the Erlang Debugger started automatically.</li><li>Use its graphical interface to investigate the state of the current test case.</li><li>Execute the test case step-by-step and/or set execution breakpoints.</li></ul><p>If no extra options are specified with flag/option <strong>step</strong>,
breakpoints are set automatically on the test cases that
are to be executed by <strong>Common Test</strong>, and those functions only. If
step option <strong>config</strong> is specified, breakpoints are also initially 
set on the configuration functions in the suite, that is,
<strong>init_per_suite/1</strong>, <strong>end_per_suite/1</strong>,
<strong>init_per_group/2</strong>, <strong>end_per_group/2</strong>,
<strong>init_per_testcase/2</strong> and <strong>end_per_testcase/2</strong>.</p><p><strong>Common Test</strong> enables the Debugger auto-attach feature, which means
that for every new interpreted test case function that starts to execute, 
a new trace window automatically pops up (as each test 
case executes on a dedicated Erlang process). Whenever a new test case starts,
<strong>Common Test</strong> attempts to close the inactive trace window of the previous 
test case. However, if you prefer <strong>Common Test</strong> to leave inactive trace 
windows, use option <strong>keep_inactive</strong>.</p><p>The step functionality can be used together with flag/option <strong>suite</strong> and 
<strong>suite</strong> + <strong>case/testcase</strong>, but not together with <strong>dir</strong>.</p><a name="test_specifications"></a><h2>Test Specifications</h2><h2>General Description</h2><p>The most flexible way to specify what to test, is to use a
test specification, which is a sequence of
Erlang terms. The terms are normally declared in one or more text files
(see <a href="./ct#run_test-1">ct#run_test-1</a>), but
can also be passed to <strong>Common Test</strong> on the form of a list (see
<a href="./ct#run_testspec-1">ct#run_testspec-1</a>).
There are two general types of terms: configuration terms and test
specification terms.</p><p>With configuration terms it is, for example, possible to do the following:</p><ul><li>Label the test run (similar to <strong>ct_run -label</strong>).</li><li>Evaluate any expressions before starting the test.</li><li>Import configuration data (similar to <strong>ct_run -config/-userconfig</strong>).</li><li>Specify the top-level HTML log directory (similar to <strong>ct_run -logdir</strong>).</li><li>Enable code coverage analysis (similar to <strong>ct_run -cover</strong>).</li><li>Install <strong>Common Test Hooks</strong> (similar to <strong>ct_run -ch_hooks</strong>).</li><li>Install <strong>event_handler</strong> plugins (similar to <strong>ct_run -event_handler</strong>).</li><li>Specify include directories to be passed to the compiler for  automatic compilation (similar to <strong>ct_run -include</strong>).</li><li>Disable the auto-compilation feature (similar to <strong>ct_run -no_auto_compile</strong>).</li><li>Set verbosity levels (similar to <strong>ct_run -verbosity</strong>).</li></ul><p>Configuration terms can be combined with <strong>ct_run</strong> start flags
or <strong>ct:run_test/1</strong> options. The result is, for some flags/options
and terms, that the values are merged (for example, configuration files,
include directories, verbosity levels, and silent connections) and for
others that the start flags/options override the test specification
terms (for example, log directory, label, style sheet, and auto-compilation).</p><p>With test specification terms, it is possible to state exactly
which tests to run and in which order. A test term specifies
either one or more suites, one or more test case groups (possibly nested),
or one or more test cases in a group (or in multiple groups) or in a suite.</p><p>Any number of test terms can be declared in sequence.
<strong>Common Test</strong> compiles by default the terms into one or more tests 
to be performed in one resulting test run. A term that
specifies a set of test cases "swallows" one that only
specifies a subset of these cases. For example, the result of merging
one term specifying that all cases in suite S are to be
executed, with another term specifying only test case X and Y in
S, is a test of all cases in S. However, if a term specifying
test case X and Y in S is merged with a term specifying case Z
in S, the result is a test of X, Y, and Z in S. To disable this
behavior, that is, to instead perform each test sequentially in a 
"script-like" manner, set term <strong>merge_tests</strong> to <strong>false</strong> 
in the test specification.</p><p>A test term can also specify one or more test suites, groups,
or test cases to be skipped. Skipped suites, groups, and cases
are not executed and show up in the HTML log files as <strong>SKIPPED</strong>.</p><h2>Using Multiple Test Specification Files</h2><p>When multiple test specification files are specified at startup (either
with <strong>ct_run -spec file1 file2 ...</strong> or 
<strong>ct:run_test([{spec, [File1,File2,...]}])</strong>), 
<strong>Common Test</strong> either executes one test run per specification file, 
or joins the files and performs all tests within one single test run. 
The first behavior is the default one. The latter requires that start
flag/option <strong>join_specs</strong> is provided, for example,
<strong>run_test -spec ./my_tests1.ts ./my_tests2.ts -join_specs</strong>.</p><p>Joining a number of specifications, or running them separately, can
also be accomplished with (and can be combined with) test specification
file inclusion.</p><h2>Test Specification File Inclusion</h2><p>With the term <strong>specs</strong>, a test specification can include 
other specifications. An included specification can either be joined 
with the source specification or used to produce a separate test run 
(as with start flag/option <strong>join_specs</strong> above).</p><p><em>Example:</em></p><pre>
 %% In specification file "a.spec"
 {specs, join, ["b.spec", "c.spec"]}.
 {specs, separate, ["d.spec", "e.spec"]}.
 %% Config and test terms follow
 ...</pre><p>In this example, the test terms defined in files "b.spec" and "c.spec"
are joined with the terms in source specification "a.spec"
(if any). The inclusion of specifications "d.spec" and
"e.spec" results in two separate, and independent, test runs
(one for each included specification).</p><p>Option <strong>join</strong> does not imply that the test terms
are merged, only that all tests are executed in one single test run.</p><p>Joined specifications share common configuration settings, such as
the list of <strong>config</strong> files or <strong>include</strong> directories.
For configurations that cannot be combined, such as settings for <strong>logdir</strong>
or <strong>verbosity</strong>, it is up to the user to ensure there are no clashes
when the test specifications are joined. Specifications included with
option <strong>separate</strong> do not share configuration settings with the
source specification. This is useful, for example, if there are clashing
configuration settings in included specifications, making it them impossible
to join.</p><p>If <strong>{merge_tests,true}</strong> is set in the source specification
(which is the default setting), terms in joined specifications are
merged with terms in the source specification (according to the
description of <strong>merge_tests</strong> earlier).</p><p>Notice that it is always the <strong>merge_tests</strong> setting in the source
specification that is used when joined with other specifications.
Say, for example, that a source specification A, with tests TA1 and TA2, has
<strong>{merge_tests,false}</strong> set, and that it includes another specification,
B, with tests TB1 and TB2, that has <strong>{merge_tests,true}</strong> set.
The result is that the test series <strong>TA1,TA2,merge(TB1,TB2)</strong>
is executed. The opposite <strong>merge_tests</strong> settings would result in
the test series <strong>merge(merge(TA1,TA2),TB1,TB2)</strong>.</p><p>The term <strong>specs</strong> can be used to nest specifications,
that is, have one specification include other specifications, which in turn
include others, and so no</p><h2>Test Case Groups</h2><p>When a test case group is specified, the resulting test
executes function <strong>init_per_group</strong>, followed by all test
cases and subgroups (including their configuration functions), and
finally function <strong>end_per_group</strong>. Also, if particular
test cases in a group are specified, <strong>init_per_group</strong>
and <strong>end_per_group</strong>, for the group in question, are
called. If a group defined (in <strong>Suite:group/0</strong>) as
a subgroup of another group, is specified (or if particular test
cases of a subgroup are), <strong>Common Test</strong> calls the configuration
functions for the top-level groups and for the subgroup
in question (making it possible to pass configuration data all
the way from <strong>init_per_suite</strong> down to the test cases in the
subgroup).</p><p>The test specification uses the same mechanism for specifying
test case groups through names and paths, as explained in section
<a href="./run_test_chapter#group_execution">Test Case Group Execution</a>,
with the addition of element <strong>GroupSpec</strong>.</p><p>Element <strong>GroupSpec</strong> makes it possible to specify
group execution properties that overrides those in the
group definition (that is, in <strong>groups/0</strong>). Execution properties for
subgroups might be overridden as well. This feature makes it possible to
change properties of groups at the time of execution,
without having to edit the test suite. The same feature is available for 
<strong>group</strong> elements in the <strong>Suite:all/0</strong> list. For details and examples,
see section <a href="./write_test_chapter#test_case_groups"> Test Case Groups</a>.</p><h2>Test Specification Syntax</h2><p>Test specifications can be used to run tests both in a single 
test host environment and in a distributed <strong>Common Test</strong> environment 
(Large Scale Testing). The node parameters in term <strong>init</strong> are only
relevant in the latter (see section
<a href="./ct_master_chapter#test_specifications">Test Specifications</a> 
in Large Scale Testing). For details about the various terms, see the 
corresponding sections in the User's Guide, for example, the following:

 Comment         = string() | ""</pre><p>The difference between the <strong>config</strong> terms above is that with
<strong>ConfigDir</strong>, <strong>ConfigBaseNames</strong> is a list of base names,
that is, without directory paths. <strong>ConfigFiles</strong> must be full names,
including paths. For example, the following two terms have the same meaning:</p><pre>
 {config, ["/home/testuser/tests/config/nodeA.cfg",
           "/home/testuser/tests/config/nodeB.cfg"]}.

 {config, "/home/testuser/tests/config", ["nodeA.cfg","nodeB.cfg"]}.</pre><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>Any relative paths, specified in the test specification, are
relative to the directory containing the test specification file if
<strong>ct_run -spec TestSpecFile ...</strong> or
<strong>ct:run:test([{spec,TestSpecFile},...])</strong>
executes the test.</p><p>The path is relative to the top-level log directory if
<strong>ct:run:testspec(TestSpec)</strong> executes the test.</p></div><h2>Constants</h2><p>The term <strong>define</strong> introduces a constant that is used to
replace the name <strong>Constant</strong> with <strong>Value</strong>, wherever it is found in
the test specification. This replacement occurs during an initial iteration
through the test specification. Constants can be used anywhere in the test
specification, for example, in any lists and tuples, and even in strings
and inside the value part of other constant definitions. A constant can
also be part of a node name, but that is the only place where a constant
can be part of an atom.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>For the sake of readability, the name of the constant must always
begin with an uppercase letter, or a <strong>$</strong>, <strong>?</strong>, or <strong>_</strong>.
This means that it must always be single quoted (as the constant name is 
an atom, not text).</p></div><p>The main benefit of constants is that they can be used to reduce the size
(and avoid repetition) of long strings, such as file paths.</p><p><em>Examples:</em></p><pre>
 %% 1a. no constant
 {config, "/home/testuser/tests/config", ["nodeA.cfg","nodeB.cfg"]}.
 {suites, "/home/testuser/tests/suites", all}.

 %% 1b. with constant
 {define, 'TESTDIR', "/home/testuser/tests"}.
 {config, "'TESTDIR'/config", ["nodeA.cfg","nodeB.cfg"]}.
 {suites, "'TESTDIR'/suites", all}.

 %% 2a. no constants
 {config, [testnode@host1, testnode@host2], "../config", ["nodeA.cfg","nodeB.cfg"]}.
 {suites, [testnode@host1, testnode@host2], "../suites", [x_SUITE, y_SUITE]}.

 %% 2b. with constants
 {define, 'NODE', testnode}.
 {define, 'NODES', ['NODE'@host1, 'NODE'@host2]}.
 {config, 'NODES', "../config", ["nodeA.cfg","nodeB.cfg"]}.
 {suites, 'NODES', "../suites", [x_SUITE, y_SUITE]}.</pre><p>Constants make the test specification term <strong>alias</strong>, in previous
versions of <strong>Common Test</strong>, redundant. This term is deprecated but
remains supported in upcoming <strong>Common Test</strong> releases. Replacing <strong>alias</strong>
terms with <strong>define</strong> is strongly recommended though. An example
of such replacement follows:</p><pre>
 %% using the old alias term
 {config, "/home/testuser/tests/config/nodeA.cfg"}.
 {alias, suite_dir, "/home/testuser/tests/suites"}.
 {groups, suite_dir, x_SUITE, group1}.

 %% replacing with constants
 {define, 'TestDir', "/home/testuser/tests"}.
 {define, 'CfgDir', "'TestDir'/config"}.
 {define, 'SuiteDir', "'TestDir'/suites"}.
 {config, 'CfgDir', "nodeA.cfg"}.
 {groups, 'SuiteDir', x_SUITE, group1}.</pre><p>Constants can well replace term <strong>node</strong> also, but
this still has a declarative value, mainly when used in combination
with <strong>NodeRefs == all_nodes</strong> 
(see <a href="#types">Types</a>).</p><h2>Example</h2><p>Here follows a simple test specification example:</p><pre>
 {define, 'Top', "/home/test"}.
 {define, 'T1', "'Top'/t1"}.
 {define, 'T2', "'Top'/t2"}.
 {define, 'T3', "'Top'/t3"}.
 {define, 'CfgFile', "config.cfg"}.

 {logdir, "'Top'/logs"}.

 {config, ["'T1'/'CfgFile'", "'T2'/'CfgFile'", "'T3'/'CfgFile'"]}.

 {suites, 'T1', all}.
 {skip_suites, 'T1', [t1B_SUITE,t1D_SUITE], "Not implemented"}.
 {skip_cases, 'T1', t1A_SUITE, [test3,test4], "Irrelevant"}.
 {skip_cases, 'T1', t1C_SUITE, [test1], "Ignore"}.

 {suites, 'T2', [t2B_SUITE,t2C_SUITE]}.
 {cases, 'T2', t2A_SUITE, [test4,test1,test7]}.

 {skip_suites, 'T3', all, "Not implemented"}.</pre><p>The example specifies the following:</p><ul><li>The specified <strong>logdir</strong> directory is used for storing  the HTML log files (in subdirectories tagged with node name,  date, and time).</li><li>The variables in the specified test system configuration files are imported for the test.</li><li>The first test to run includes all suites for system <strong>t1</strong>.  Suites <strong>t1B</strong> and <strong>t1D</strong> are excluded from the test. Test cases  <strong>test3</strong> and <strong>test4</strong> in <strong>t1A</strong> and <strong>test1</strong> case in <strong>t1C</strong>  are also excluded from the test.</li><li>The second test to run is for system <strong>t2</strong>. The included suites are <strong>t2B</strong> and <strong>t2C</strong>. Test cases <strong>test4</strong>, <strong>test1</strong>, and <strong>test7</strong> in suite <strong>t2A</strong> are also included. The test cases are executed in the specified order.</li><li>The last test to run is for system <strong>t3</strong>. Here, all suites are skipped and this is explicitly noted in the log files.</li></ul><h2>The init Term</h2><p>With term <strong>init</strong> it is possible to specify initialization options
for nodes defined in the test specification. There are options
to start the node and to evaluate any function on the node.
For details, see section <a href="./ct_master_chapter#ct_slave">Automatic Startup of Test Target Nodes</a> in section Using Common Test for Large Scale Testing.</p><h2>User-Specific Terms</h2><p>The user can provide a test specification including (for <strong>Common Test</strong>) 
unrecognizable terms. If this is desired, use flag <strong>-allow_user_terms</strong> 
when starting tests with <strong>ct_run</strong>. This forces <strong>Common Test</strong> to ignore 
unrecognizable terms. In this mode, <strong>Common Test</strong> is not able to check the 
specification for errors as efficiently as if the scanner runs in default mode. 
If <a href="./ct#run_test-1">ct#run_test-1</a> is used
for starting the tests, the relaxed scanner mode is enabled by tuple
<strong>{allow_user_terms,true}</strong>.</p><h2>Reading Test Specification Terms</h2><p>Terms in the current test specification
(that is, the specification that has been used to configure and run the current test)
can be looked up.
The function <a href="./ct#get_testspec_terms-0">ct#get_testspec_terms-0</a> 
returns a list of all test specification terms (both configuration terms and test terms), 
and <strong>get_testspec_terms(Tags)</strong> returns the term (or a list of terms) matching the 
tag (or tags) in <strong>Tags</strong>.</p><p>For example, in the test specification:</p><pre>
 ...
 {label, my_server_smoke_test}.
 {config, "../../my_server_setup.cfg"}.
 {config, "../../my_server_interface.cfg"}.
 ...</pre><p>And in, for example, a test suite or a <strong>Common Test Hook</strong> function:</p><pre>
 ...
 [{label,[{_Node,TestType}]}, {config,CfgFiles}] =
     ct:get_testspec_terms([label,config]),

 [verify_my_server_cfg(TestType, CfgFile) || {Node,CfgFile} &lt;- CfgFiles,
					     Node == node()];
 ...</pre><h2>Running Tests from the Web-Based GUI</h2><p>The web-based GUI, Virtual Test Server (VTS), is started with the
<a href="./run_test_chapter#ct_run">run_test_chapter#ct_run</a>
program. From the GUI, you can load configuration files and select
directories, suites, and cases to run. You can also state the
configuration files, directories, suites, and cases on the command line
when starting the web-based GUI.
</p><p><em>Examples:</em></p><ul><li><strong>ct_run -vts</strong></li><li><strong>ct_run -vts -config &lt;configfilename&gt;</strong></li><li><strong>ct_run -vts -config &lt;configfilename&gt; -suite &lt;suitewithfullpath&gt; -case &lt;casename&gt;</strong></li></ul><p>From the GUI you can run tests and view the result and the logs.
</p><p><strong>ct_run -vts</strong> tries to open the <strong>Common Test</strong> start
page in an existing web browser window, or start the browser if it is
not running. Which browser to start can be specified with
the browser start command option:</p><p><strong>ct_run -vts -browser &lt;browser_start_cmd&gt;</strong></p><p><em>Example:</em></p><p><strong>$ ct_run -vts -browser 'firefox&amp;'</strong></p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>The browser must run as a separate OS process, otherwise VTS hangs.</p></div><p>If no specific browser start command is specified, Firefox is
the default browser on Unix platforms, and Internet Explorer on Windows.
If <strong>Common Test</strong> fails to start a browser automatically, or <strong>none</strong> is
specified as the value for <strong>-browser</strong> (that is, <strong>-browser none</strong>), start your
favourite browser manually and type the URL that <strong>Common Test</strong>
displays in the shell.</p><a name="log_files"></a><h2>Log Files</h2><p>As the execution of the test suites proceed, events are logged in
the following four different ways:</p><ul><li>Text to the operator console.</li><li>Suite-related information is sent to the major log file.</li><li>Case-related information is sent to the minor log file.</li><li>The HTML overview log file is updated with test results.</li><li>A link to all runs executed from a certain directory is written in the log named <strong>all_runs.html</strong> and direct links to all tests (the latest results) are written to the top-level <strong>index.html</strong>.</li></ul><p>Typically the operator, possibly running hundreds or thousands of
test cases, does not want to fill the console with details
about, or printouts from, specific test cases. By default, the 
operator only sees the following:</p><ul><li>A confirmation that the test has started and information about how  many test cases are executed in total.</li><li>A small note about each failed test case.</li><li>A summary of all the run test cases.</li><li>A confirmation when the test run is complete.</li><li>Some special information, such as error reports, progress reports, and printouts written with <strong>erlang:display/1</strong>, or <strong>io:format/3</strong> specifically addressed to a receiver other than <strong>standard_io</strong> (for example, the default group leader process <strong>user</strong>).</li></ul><p>To dig deeper into the general results, or
the result of a specific test case, the operator can do so by
following the links in the HTML presentation and read the
major or minor log files. The "all_runs.html" page is a good
starting point. It is located in <strong>logdir</strong> and contains
a link to each test run, including a quick overview (with date and time,
node name, number of tests, test names, and test result totals).</p><p>An "index.html" page is written for each test run (that is, stored in
the <strong>ct_run</strong> directory tagged with node name, date, and time). This
file provides an overview of all individual tests performed in the 
same test run. The test names follow the following convention:</p><ul><li><strong>TopLevelDir.TestDir</strong> (all suites in <strong>TestDir</strong> executed)</li><li><strong>TopLevelDir.TestDir:suites</strong> (specific suites executed)</li><li><strong>TopLevelDir.TestDir.Suite</strong> (all cases in <strong>Suite</strong> executed)</li><li><strong>TopLevelDir.TestDir.Suite:cases</strong> (specific test cases executed)</li><li><strong>TopLevelDir.TestDir.Suite.Case</strong> (only <strong>Case</strong> executed)</li></ul><p>The "test run index" page includes a link to the <strong>Common Test</strong>
Framework Log file in which information about imported
configuration data and general test progress is written. This
log file is useful to get snapshot information about the test
run during execution. It can also be helpful when
analyzing test results or debugging test suites.</p><p>The "test run index" page indicates if a test has missing
suites (that is, suites that <strong>Common Test</strong> failed to
compile). Names of the missing suites can be found in the
<strong>Common Test</strong> Framework Log file.</p><p>The major log file shows a detailed report of the test run. It
includes test suite and test case names, execution time, the 
exact reason for failures, and so on. The information is available in both
a file with textual and with HTML representation. The HTML file shows a 
summary that gives a good overview of the test run. It also has links 
to each individual test case log file for quick viewing with an HTML 
browser.</p><p>The minor log files contain full details of every single test
case, each in a separate file. This way, it is
straightforward	to compare the latest results to that of previous
test runs, even if the set of test cases changes. If application SASL
is running, its logs are also printed to the current minor log file by the
<a href="../common_test/ct_hooks_chapter#builtin_cths"> cth_log_redirect built-in hook</a>.
</p><p>The full name of the minor log file (that is, the name of the file
including the absolute directory path) can be read during execution
of the test case. It comes as value in tuple
<strong>{tc_logfile,LogFileName}</strong> in the <strong>Config</strong> list (which means it
can also be read by a pre- or post <strong>Common Test Hook</strong> function). Also,
at the start of a test case, this data is sent with an event
to any installed event handler.	For details, see section
<a href="./event_handler_chapter#event_handling">Event Handling</a>.
</p><p>The log files are written continuously during a test run and links are
always created initially when a test starts. Thevtest progress can therefore 
be followed simply by refreshing pages in the HTML browser.
Statistics totals are not presented until a test is complete however.</p><a name="logopts"></a><h2>Log Options</h2><p>With start flag <strong>logopts</strong> options that modify some aspects 
of the logging behavior can be specified.
The following options are available:</p><dl><dt><strong>no_src</strong></dt><dd><p>The HTML version of the test suite source code is not 
generated during the test run (and is consequently not available 
in the log file system).</p></dd><dt><strong>no_nl</strong></dt><dd><p><strong>Common Test</strong> does not add a newline character <strong>(\n)</strong> 
to the end of an output string that it receives from a call to, for example, 
<strong>io:format/2</strong>, and which it prints to the test case log.</p></dd></dl><p>For example, if a test is started with:</p><p><strong>$ ct_run -suite my_SUITE -logopts no_nl</strong></p><p>then printouts during the test made by successive calls to <strong>io:format("x")</strong>,
appears in the test case log as:</p><p><strong>xxx</strong></p><p>instead of each <strong>x</strong> printed on a new line, which is the default behavior.</p><a name="table_sorting"></a><h2>Sorting HTML Table Columns</h2><p>By clicking the name in the column header of any table 
(for example, "Ok", "Case", "Time", and so on), the table rows are sorted 
in whatever order makes sense for the type of value (for example,
numerical for "Ok" or "Time", and alphabetical for "Case"). The sorting is 
performed through JavaScript code, automatically inserted into the HTML 
log files. <strong>Common Test</strong> uses the <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> 
library and the
<a href="http://tablesorter.com">tablesorter</a> plugin, 
with customized sorting functions, for this implementation.</p><h2>The Unexpected I/O Log</h2><p>The test suites overview page includes a link to the Unexpected I/O Log.
In this log, <strong>Common Test</strong> saves printouts made with
<a href="./ct#log-2">ct#log-2</a> and 
<a href="./ct#pal-2">ct#pal-2</a>, as well as captured system 
error- and progress reports, which cannot be associated with particular test cases and
therefore cannot be written to individual test case log files. This occurs,
for example, if a log printout is made from an external process (not a test 
case process), <em>or</em> if an error- or progress report comes in, during a short 
interval while <strong>Common Test</strong> is not executing a test case or configuration 
function, <em>or</em> while <strong>Common Test</strong> is currently executing a parallel 
test case group.</p><a name="pre_post_test_io_log"></a><h2>The Pre- and Post Test I/O Log</h2><p>The <strong>Common Test</strong> Framework Log page includes links to the
Pre- and Post Test I/O Log. In this log, <strong>Common Test</strong> saves printouts made 
with <strong>ct:log/1,2,3,4,5</strong> and <strong>ct:pal/1,2,3,4,5</strong>, as well as captured system error-
and progress reports, which take place before, and after, the test run.
Examples of this are printouts from a CT hook init- or terminate function, or
progress reports generated when an OTP application is started from a CT hook
init function. Another example is an error report generated because of
a failure when an external application is stopped from a CT hook terminate function.
All information in these examples ends up in the Pre- and Post Test I/O Log.
For more information on how to synchronize test runs with external user
applications, see section
<a href="./ct_hooks_chapter#synchronizing">Synchronizing</a>
in section Common Test Hooks.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>Logging to file with <strong>ct:log/1,2,3,4,5</strong> or <strong>ct:pal/1,2,3,4,5</strong>
only works when <strong>Common Test</strong> is running. Printouts with <strong>ct:pal/1,2,3,4,5</strong>
are however always displayed on screen.</p></div><a name="delete_old_logs"></a><h2>Delete Old Logs</h2><p><strong>Common Test</strong> can automatically delete old log. This
is specified with the <strong>keep_logs</strong> option. The default
value for this option is <strong>all</strong>, which means that no
logs are deleted. If the value is set to an
integer, <strong>N</strong>, <strong>Common Test</strong> deletes
all <strong>ct_run.&lt;timestamp&gt;</strong> directories, except
the <strong>N</strong> newest.</p><a name="html_stylesheet"></a><h2>HTML Style Sheets</h2><p><strong>Common Test</strong> uses an HTML Style Sheet (CSS file) to control the look of
the HTML log files generated during test runs. If the log files are not 
displayed correctly in the browser of your choice, or you prefer a more 
primitive ("pre <strong>Common Test</strong> v1.6") look of the logs, use the start 
flag/option:</p><pre>
 basic_html</pre><p>This disables the use of style sheets and JavaScripts (see
<a href="#table_sorting">Sorting HTML Table Columns</a>).</p><p><strong>Common Test</strong> includes an <em>optional</em> feature to allow
user HTML style sheets for customizing printouts. The
functions in <strong>ct</strong> that print to a test case HTML log
file (<strong>log/3,4,5</strong> and <strong>pal/3,4,5</strong>) accept <strong>Category</strong>
as first argument. With this argument a category can be specified 
that can be mapped to a named <strong>div</strong> selector in a CSS rule-set.
This is useful, especially for coloring text
differently depending on the type of (or reason for) the
printout. Say you want one particular background color for test system
configuration information, a different one for test system
state information, and finally one for errors detected by the
test case functions. The corresponding style sheet can
look as follows:</p><pre>
 div.sys_config  { background:blue }
 div.sys_state   { background:yellow }
 div.error       { background:red }</pre><p>Common Test prints the text from <strong>ct:log/3,4,5</strong> or
<strong>ct:pal/3,4,5</strong> inside a <strong>pre</strong> element
nested under the named <strong>div</strong> element. Since the <strong>pre</strong> selector
has a predefined CSS rule (in file <strong>ct_default.css</strong>) for the attributes
<strong>color</strong>, <strong>font-family</strong> and <strong>font-size</strong>, if a user wants to
change any of the predefined attribute settings, a new rule for <strong>pre</strong>
must be added to the user stylesheet. Example:</p><pre>
div.error pre { color:white }</pre><p>Here, white text is used instead of the default black for <strong>div.error</strong>
printouts (and no other attribute settings for <strong>pre</strong> are affected).</p><p>To install the CSS file (<strong>Common Test</strong> inlines the definition in the 
HTML code), the file name can be provided when executing <strong>ct_run</strong>.</p><p><em>Example:</em></p><pre>
 $ ct_run -dir $TEST/prog -stylesheet $TEST/styles/test_categories.css</pre><p>Categories in a CSS file installed with flag <strong>-stylesheet</strong>
are on a global test level in the sense that they can be used in any 
suite that is part of the test run.</p><p>Style sheets can also be installed on a per suite and
per test case basis.</p><p><em>Example:</em></p><pre>
 -module(my_SUITE).
 ...
 suite() -&gt; [..., {stylesheet,"suite_categories.css"}, ...].
 ...
 my_testcase(_) -&gt;
     ...
     ct:log(sys_config, "Test node version: ~p", [VersionInfo]),
     ...
     ct:log(sys_state, "Connections: ~p", [ConnectionInfo]),
     ...
     ct:pal(error, "Error ~p detected! Info: ~p", [SomeFault,ErrorInfo]),
     ct:fail(SomeFault).</pre><p>If the style sheet is installed as in this example, the categories are 
private to the suite in question. They can be used by all test cases in the 
suite, but cannot be used by other suites. A suite private style sheet, 
if specified, is used in favor of a global style sheet (one specified 
with flag <strong>-stylesheet</strong>). A stylesheet tuple (as returned by <strong>suite/0</strong> 
above) can also be returned from a test case information function. In this case the 
categories specified in the style sheet can only be used in that particular 
test case. A test case private style sheet is used in favor of a suite or 
global level style sheet.
</p><p>In a tuple <strong>{stylesheet,CSSFile}</strong>, if <strong>CSSFile</strong> is specified
with a path, for example, <strong>"$TEST/styles/categories.css"</strong>, this full
name is used to locate the file. However, if only the file name is specified,
for example, <strong>categories.css</strong>, the CSS file is assumed to be located
in the data directory, <strong>data_dir</strong>, of the suite. The latter use is
recommended, as it is portable compared to hard coding path names in the 
suite.</p><p>Argument <strong>Category</strong> in the previous example can have the
value (atom) <strong>sys_config</strong> (blue background), <strong>sys_state</strong>
(yellow background), or <strong>error</strong> (white text on red background).</p><a name="repeating_tests"></a><h2>Repeating Tests</h2><p>You can order <strong>Common Test</strong> to repeat the tests you specify. You can choose
to repeat tests a number of times, repeat tests for a specific period of time, 
or repeat tests until a particular stop time is reached. If repetition is controlled by
time, an action for <strong>Common Test</strong> to take upon time-out can be specified. 
Either <strong>Common Test</strong> performs all tests in the current run 
before stopping, or it stops when the current test job is finished. Repetition 
can be activated by <strong>ct_run</strong> start flags, or tuples in the <strong>ct:run:test/1</strong>
option list argument. The flags (options in parentheses) are the following:</p><ul><li><strong>-repeat N ({repeat,N})</strong>, where <strong>N</strong> is a positive integer</li><li><strong>-duration DurTime ({duration,DurTime})</strong>, where <strong>DurTime</strong> is the duration</li><li><strong>-until StopTime ({until,StopTime})</strong>, where <strong>StopTime</strong> is finish time</li><li><strong>-force_stop ({force_stop,true})</strong></li><li><strong>-force_stop skip_rest ({force_stop,skip_rest})</strong></li></ul><dl><dt><strong>DurTime</strong></dt><dd><p>The duration time is specified as <strong>HHMMSS</strong>, for example, <strong>-duration 012030</strong> 
or <strong>{duration,"012030"}</strong></p>, which means that the tests are executed and  (if time allows) repeated until time-out occurs after 1 hour, 20 minutes, and 30 seconds. </dd><dt><strong>StopTime</strong></dt><dd><p>The finish time can be specified as <strong>HHMMSS</strong> and is then interpreted as a 
time today (or possibly tomorrow), but can also be specified as <strong>YYMoMoDDHHMMSS</strong>,
for example, <strong>-until 071001120000</strong> or <strong>{until,"071001120000"}</strong>. This means
that the tests are executed and (if time allows) repeated, until 12 o'clock on the 1st 
of October 2007.</p> </dd></dl><p>When time-out occurs, <strong>Common Test</strong> never aborts the ongoing test case,
as this can leave the SUT in an undefined, and possibly bad, state.
Instead <strong>Common Test</strong>, by default, finishes the current test
run before stopping. If flag <strong>force_stop</strong> is
specified, <strong>Common Test</strong> stops when the current test job
is finished. If flag <strong>force_stop</strong> is specified with
<strong>skip_rest</strong>, <strong>Common Test</strong> only completes the current
test case and skips the remaining tests in the test job.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>As <strong>Common Test</strong> always finishes at least the current test case,
the time specified with <strong>duration</strong> or <strong>until</strong> is never definitive.</p></div><p>Log files from every repeated test run is saved in normal <strong>Common Test</strong> 
fashion (described earlier).</p><p><strong>Common Test</strong> might later support an optional feature to only store the last (and possibly 
the first) set of logs of repeated test runs, but for now the user must be careful not 
to run out of disk space if tests are repeated during long periods of time.</p><p>For each test run that is part of a repeated session, information about the
particular test run is printed in the <strong>Common Test</strong> Framework Log. The information
includes the repetition number, remaining time, and so on.</p><p><em>Example 1:</em></p><pre>
 $ ct_run -dir $TEST_ROOT/to1 $TEST_ROOT/to2 -duration 001000 -force_stop</pre><p>Here, the suites in test directory <strong>to1</strong>, followed by the suites in <strong>to2</strong>, are 
executed in one test run. A time-out event occurs after 10 minutes. As long as there is 
time left, <strong>Common Test</strong> repeats the test run (that is, starting over with test <strong>to1</strong>). 
After time-out, <strong>Common Test</strong> stops when the current job is finished
(because of flag <strong>force_stop</strong>). As a result, the specified test run can be 
aborted after test <strong>to1</strong> and before test <strong>to2</strong>.</p><p><em>Example 2:</em></p><pre>
 $ ct_run -dir $TEST_ROOT/to1 $TEST_ROOT/to2 -duration 001000 -forces_stop skip_rest</pre><p>Here, the same tests as in Example 1 are run, but with flag <strong>force_stop</strong> set to 
<strong>skip_rest</strong>. If time-out occurs while executing tests in directory <strong>to1</strong>, 
the remaining test cases in <strong>to1</strong> are skipped and the test is aborted without 
running the tests in <strong>to2</strong> another time. If time-out occurs while executing 
tests in directory <strong>to2</strong>, the remaining test cases in <strong>to2</strong> are skipped and 
the test is aborted.</p><p><em>Example 3:</em></p><pre>
 $ date
 Fri Sep 28 15:00:00 MEST 2007

 $ ct_run -dir $TEST_ROOT/to1 $TEST_ROOT/to2 -until 160000</pre><p>Here, the same test run as in the previous examples are executed (and possibly repeated). 
However, when the time-out occurs, after 1 hour, <strong>Common Test</strong> finishes the entire 
test run before stopping (that is, both <strong>to1</strong> and <strong>to2</strong> are always executed in 
the same test run).</p><p><em>Example 4:</em></p><pre>
 $ ct_run -dir $TEST_ROOT/to1 $TEST_ROOT/to2 -repeat 5</pre><p>Here, the test run, including both the <strong>to1</strong> and the <strong>to2</strong> test, is repeated 
five times.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>Do not confuse this feature with the <strong>repeat</strong> property of a test
case group. The options described here are used to repeat execution of entire test runs,
while the <strong>repeat</strong> property of a test case group makes it possible to repeat
execution of sets of test cases within a suite. For more information about the latter,
see section <a href="./write_test_chapter#test_case_groups">Test Case Groups </a>
in section Writing Test Suites.</p></div><a name="silent_connections"></a><h2>Silent Connections</h2><p>The protocol handling processes in <strong>Common Test</strong>, implemented by <strong>ct_telnet</strong>,
<strong>ct_ssh</strong>, <strong>ct_ftp</strong>, and so on, do verbose printing to the test case logs. 
This can be switched off with flag <strong>-silent_connections</strong>:</p><pre>
 ct_run -silent_connections [conn_types]</pre><p>Here, <strong>conn_types</strong> specifies SSH, Telnet, FTP, RPC, and/or SNMP.</p><p><em>Example 1:</em></p><pre>
 ct_run ... -silent_connections ssh telnet</pre><p>This switches off logging for SSH and Telnet connections.</p><p><em>Example 2:</em></p><pre>
 ct_run ... -silent_connections</pre><p>This switches off logging for all connection types.</p><p>Fatal communication error and reconnection attempts are always printed, even if 
logging has been suppressed for the connection type in question. However, operations
such as sending and receiving data are performed silently.</p><p><strong>silent_connections</strong> can also be specified in a test suite. This is
accomplished by returning a tuple, <strong>{silent_connections,ConnTypes}</strong>, in the
<strong>suite/0</strong> or test case information list. If <strong>ConnTypes</strong> is a list of atoms 
(SSH, Telnet, FTP, RPC and/or SNMP), output for any corresponding connections 
are suppressed. Full logging is by default enabled for any connection of type not 
specified in <strong>ConnTypes</strong>. Hence, if <strong>ConnTypes</strong> is the empty list, logging 
is enabled for all connections.</p><p><em>Example 3:</em></p><pre>
 -module(my_SUITE).

     [{silent_connections,[ssh]}].

 my_testcase1(_) -&gt;
     ...

 my_testcase2(_) -&gt;
     ...</pre><p>In this example, <strong>suite/0</strong> tells <strong>Common Test</strong> to suppress
printouts from Telnet and SSH connections. This is valid for
all test cases. However, <strong>my_testcase1/0</strong> specifies that
for this test case, only SSH is to be silent. The result is
that <strong>my_testcase1</strong> gets Telnet information (if any) printed
in the log, but not SSH information. <strong>my_testcase2</strong> gets no
information from either connection printed.</p><p><strong>silent_connections</strong> can also be specified with a term
in a test specification
(see section <a href="./run_test_chapter#test_specifications">Test Specifications</a> in section Running Tests and Analyzing Results).
Connections provided with start	flag/option <strong>silent_connections</strong>
are merged with any connections listed in the test specification.</p><p>Start flag/option <strong>silent_connections</strong> and the test
specification term override any settings made by the information functions
inside the test suite.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>In the current <strong>Common Test</strong> version, the
<strong>silent_connections</strong> feature only works for Telnet
and SSH connections. Support for other connection types can be added
in future <strong>Common Test</strong> versions.</p></div></body></html>
