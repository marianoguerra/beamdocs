they are only started and stopped during runtime and cannot 
be started at application startup.
The FTP client API is designed to allow some functions to 
return intermediate results. This implies that only the process
that started the FTP client can access it with
preserved sane semantics. 
If the process that started the FTP session 
dies, the FTP client process terminates.</p><p>The client supports IPv6 as long as the underlying mechanisms
also do so.</p><p>The following is a simple example of an FTP session, where
the user <strong>guest</strong> with password <strong>password</strong> logs on to
the remote host <strong>erlang.org</strong>:</p><pre><code class="erl">
      1&gt; ftp:start().
      ok
      2&gt; {ok, Pid} = ftp:start_service([{host, "erlang.org"}]).
      {ok,&lt;0.22.0&gt;}
      3&gt; ftp:user(Pid, "guest", "password").
      ok
      4&gt; ftp:pwd(Pid).
      {ok, "/home/guest"}
      5&gt; ftp:cd(Pid, "appl/examples").
      ok
      6&gt; ftp:lpwd(Pid).
      {ok, "/home/fred"}.
      7&gt; ftp:lcd(Pid, "/home/eproj/examples").
      ok
      8&gt; ftp:recv(Pid, "appl.erl").
      ok
      9&gt; ftp:stop_service(Pid).
      ok
      10&gt; ftp:stop().
      ok
    </code></pre><p> The file
<strong>appl.erl</strong> is transferred from the remote to the local
host.  When the session is opened, the current directory at
the remote host is <strong>/home/guest</strong>, and <strong>/home/fred</strong>
at the local host. Before transferring the file, the current
local directory is changed to <strong>/home/eproj/examples</strong>, and
the remote directory is set to
<strong>/home/guest/appl/examples</strong>.</p></body></html>
