event log. It is part of the OS_Mon application, see
<a href="os_mon_app">os_mon(6)</a>. Available for
Windows versions where the event log is available. That is, not
for Windows 98 and some other older Windows versions, but for most
(all?) newer Windows versions.This module is used as the Windows backend for <strong>os_sup</strong>, see
<a href="os_sup">os_sup(3)</a>.To retain backwards compatibility, this module can also be used
to start a standalone <strong>nteventlog</strong> process which is not part
of the OS_Mon supervision tree. When starting such a process,
the user has to supply an identifier as well as a callback
function to handle the messages.The identifier, an arbitrary string, should be reused whenever
the same application (or node) wants to start the process.
<strong>nteventlog</strong> is informed about all events that have arrived
to the eventlog since the last accepted message for the current
identifier. As long as the same identifier is used, the same
eventlog record will not be sent to <strong>nteventlog</strong> more than
once (with the exception of when graved system failures arise, in
which case the last records written before the failure may be
sent to Erlang again after reboot).If the event log is configured to wrap around automatically,
records that have arrived to the log and been overwritten when
<strong>nteventlog</strong> was not running are lost. It however detects
this state and loses no records that are not overwritten.The callback function works as described in <strong>os_sup(3)</strong>.</p><h1>Functions</h1><h2>start(Identifier, MFA) -&gt; Result</h2><h2>start_link(Identifier, MFA) -&gt; Result</h2><p>Start the NT eventlog server</p><ul><li><span class="v">Identifier = string() | atom()</span></li><li><span class="v">MFA = {Mod, Func, Args}</span></li><li><span class="v">Â Mod = Func = atom()</span></li><li><span class="v">Â Args = [term()]</span></li><li><span class="v">Result = {ok, Pid} | {error, {already_started, Pid}}</span></li><li><span class="v">Pid = pid()</span></li></ul><p>This function starts the standalone <strong>nteventlog</strong> process
