</p><p>Both the agent and the manager can be configured to log 
incoming and outgoing messages. It uses the Erlang standard log
mechanism <strong>disk_log</strong> for logging. The size and location of
the log files are configurable. A wrap log is used, which means
that when the log has grown to a maximum size, it starts from the
beginning of the log, overwriting existing log records.
</p><p>The log can be either a <strong>read</strong>, <strong>write</strong> or a 
<strong>read_write</strong>. 
</p><h2>Agent Logging</h2><p>For the agent, a <strong>write</strong>, means that all <strong>set</strong> 
requests and their responses are stored. No <strong>get</strong> requests
or traps are stored in a <strong>write</strong>. A <strong>read_write</strong>, 
all requests, responses and traps are stored.
</p><p>The log uses a raw data format (basically the BER encoded
message), in order to minimize the CPU load needed for the log
mechanism.  This means that the log is not human readable, but
needs to be formatted off-line before it can be read.  Use the
function 
<a href="./snmpa#log_to_txt">snmpa:log_to_txt</a> 
for this purpose.
</p><h2>Manager Logging</h2><p>For the manager, a <strong>write</strong>, means that all  
requests (<strong>set</strong> and <strong>get</strong>) and their responses are stored. 
No traps are stored in a <strong>write</strong>. A <strong>read_write</strong>, 
all requests, responses and traps are stored.
