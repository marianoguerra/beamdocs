that basically provides a means to communicate with agents.</p><p>It does not really implement any management capabilities by 
itself. That is up to the <em>user</em>. 
</p><p>A <em>user</em> in this context is basically a module implementing
the <a href="snmpm_user">snmpm_user</a> behaviour. 
A <em>user</em> can issue snmp requests and receive 
notification/traps.</p><p>Agents to be accessed by the manager needs to be registered by 
a user. Once registered, they can be accessed by all registered 
users.</p><p>Notifications/traps from an agent is delivered to the user that 
did the registration.</p><p>Any message from an agent that is not registered is delivered to 
the <em>default user</em>.</p><p>By default, the <em>default user</em> is set to the 
<strong>snmpm_user_default</strong> module, which simply sends an info message
to the error_logger. It is however highly recommended that this
module be replaced by another that does something useful
(see <a href="./snmp_config#configuration_params">configuration params</a> for more info).</p><p>When using version 3, then (at least one) <em>usm user</em> has to 
be registered.</p><p>Requests can be issued in two different ways. Synchronous (see
<a href="./snmpm#sync_set">sync_set</a>,
<a href="./snmpm#sync_get">sync_get</a>, 
<a href="./snmpm#sync_get_next">sync_get_next</a> and 
<a href="./snmpm#sync_get_bulk">sync_get_bulk</a>)
and asynchronous (see 
<a href="./snmpm#async_set">async_set</a>,
<a href="./snmpm#async_get">async_get</a>, 
<a href="./snmpm#async_get_next">async_get_next</a> and  
<a href="./snmpm#async_get_bulk">async_get_bulk</a>). 
With synchronous 
the snmp reply is returned by the function. With asynchronous,
the reply will instead be delivered through a call to one of the
<strong>handle_pdu</strong> callback function defined by the 
<a href="./snmpm_user#handle_pdu">handle_pdu</a> 
behaviour.</p><h2>Operation</h2><a name="operation"></a><p>The following steps are needed to get the manager running:</p><ul><li> <p>[optional] Implement the default user.</p> </li><li> <p>Implement the user(s).</p> </li><li> <p>Configure the application (manager).</p> </li><li> <p>Start the application (manager).</p> </li><li> <p>Register the user(s).</p> </li><li> <p>The user(s) register their agents.</p> </li></ul><h2>MIB loading</h2><a name="mib_loading"></a><p>It is possible to load mibs into the manager, but this is not 
necessary for normal operation, and not recommended.</p></body></html>
