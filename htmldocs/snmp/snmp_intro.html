</p><ul><li>An Extensible multi-lingual SNMP agent, which understands SNMPv1 (RFC1157), SNMPv2c (RFC1901, 1905, 1906 and 1907), SNMPv3 (RFC2271, 2272, 2273, 2274 and 2275), or any combination of these protocols. </li><li>A multi-lingual SNMP manager. </li><li>A MIB compiler, which understands SMIv1 (RFC1155, 1212, and 1215) and SMIv2 (RFC1902, 1903, and 1904). </li></ul><p>The SNMP development tool provides an environment for
rapid agent/manager prototyping and construction. With the 
following information provided, this tool is used to set up a 
running multi-lingual SNMP agent/manager:
</p><ul><li>a description of a Management Information Base (MIB) in Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) </li><li>instrumentation functions for the managed objects in the MIB, written in Erlang. </li></ul><p>The advantage of using an extensible (agent/manager) toolkit is to 
remove details such as type-checking, access rights, Protocol Data Unit
(PDU), encoding, decoding, and trap distribution from the
programmer, who only has to write the instrumentation functions,
which implement the MIBs. The <strong>get-next</strong> function only
has to be implemented for tables, and not for every variable in
the global naming tree. This information can be deduced from the
ASN.1 file.
</p><h2>Scope and Purpose</h2><p>This manual describes the SNMP development tool,
as a component of the Erlang/Open Telecom Platform development
environment. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the
Erlang Development Environment, which is described in a separate
User's Guide.</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>The following prerequisites
is required for understanding the material in the SNMP
User's Guide:
</p><ul><li>the basics of the Simple Network Management Protocol version 1 (SNMPv1) </li><li>the basics of the community-based Simple Network Management Protocol version 2 (SNMPv2c) </li><li>the basics of the Simple Network Management Protocol version 3 (SNMPv3) </li><li>the knowledge of defining MIBs using SMIv1 and SMIv2 </li><li>familiarity with the Erlang system and Erlang programming </li></ul><p>The tool requires Erlang release 4.7 or later.
</p><h2>Definitions</h2><p>The following definitions are used in the SNMP User's Guide.
</p><dl><dt>MIB</dt><dd>The conceptual repository for management information is called the Management Information Base (MIB). It  does not hold any data, merely a definition of what data can be accessed.  A definition of an MIB is a description of a collection of managed objects. </dd><dt>SMI</dt><dd>The MIB is specified in an adapted subset of the Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) language.  This adapted subset is called the Structure of Management Information (SMI). </dd><dt>ASN.1</dt><dd>ASN.1 is used in two different ways in SNMP.  The SMI is based on ASN.1, and the messages in the protocol are defined by using ASN.1. </dd><dt>Managed object</dt><dd> <p>A resource to be managed is represented by a managed
object, which resides in the MIB. In an SNMP MIB, the managed
objects are either:</p> <ul><li><em>scalar variables</em>, which have only one instance per context. They have single values, not multiple values like vectors or structures. </li><li><em>tables</em>, which can grow dynamically. </li><li>a <em>table element</em>, which is a special type of scalar variable.</li></ul> </dd><dt>Operations</dt><dd>SNMP relies on the three basic operations: get (object), set (object, value) and get-next (object). </dd><dt>Instrumentation function</dt><dd>An instrumentation function is associated with each managed object. This is the function, which actually implements the operations and will be called by the agent when it receives a request from the management station.</dd><dt>Manager</dt><dd>A manager generates commands and receives notifications  from agents. There usually are only a few managers in a system.</dd><dt>Agent</dt><dd>An agent responds to commands from the manager, and sends notification to the manager. There are potentially many agents  in a system.</dd></dl><h2>About This Manual</h2><p>In addition to this introductory chapter, the SNMP User's Guide
contains the following chapters:
</p><ul><li>Chapter 2: "Functional Description" describes the features and operation of the SNMP development toolkit. It includes topics on Sub-agents and MIB loading, Internal MIBs, and Traps. </li><li>Chapter 3: "The MIB Compiler" describes the features and the operation of the MIB compiler. </li><li>Chapter 4: "Running the application" describes how to start and configure the application. Topics on how to debug the application  are also included. </li><li>Chapter 5: "Definition of Agent Configuration Files" is a reference chapter, which contains more detailed information about the agent configuration files. </li><li>Chapter 6: "Definition of Manager Configuration Files" is a reference chapter, which contains more detailed information about the manager configuration files. </li><li>Chapter 7: "Agent Implementation Example" describes how an MIB can be implemented with the SNMP Development Toolkit.  Implementation examples are included. </li><li>Chapter 8: "Instrumentation Functions" describes how instrumentation functions should be defined in Erlang for the different operations. </li><li>Chapter 9: "Definition of Instrumentation Functions" is a reference chapter which contains more detailed information about the instrumentation functions. </li><li>Chapter 10: "Definition of Agent Net if" is a reference chapter, which describes the Agent Net if function in detail. </li><li>Chapter 11: "Definition of Manager Net if" is a reference chapter, which describes the Manager Net if function in detail. </li><li>Chapter 12: "Advanced Agent Topics" describes sub-agents, agent semantics, audit trail logging, and the consideration of distributed tables. </li><li>Appendix A describes the conversion of SNMPv2 to SNMPv1 error messages. </li><li>Appendix B contains the RFC1903 text on <strong>RowStatus</strong>. </li></ul><h2>Where to Find More Information</h2><p>Refer to the following documentation for more information about
