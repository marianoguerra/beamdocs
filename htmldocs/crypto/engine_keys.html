<a name="engine_key"></a>
This chapter describes the support in the crypto application for using public and private keys stored in encryption engines.
</p><h2>Background</h2><p>
<a href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a> exposes an Engine API, which makes 
it possible to plug in alternative implementations for some of the cryptographic
operations implemented by OpenSSL.
See the chapter <a href="../crypto/engine_load#engine_load">Engine Load</a>
for details and how to load an Engine.
</p><p>
An engine could among other tasks provide a storage for
private or public keys. Such a storage could be made safer than the normal file system. Those techniques are not
described in this User's Guide.  Here we concentrate on how to use private or public keys stored in
such an engine.
</p><p>
The storage engine must call <strong>ENGINE_set_load_privkey_function</strong> and <strong>ENGINE_set_load_pubkey_function</strong>.
See the OpenSSL cryptolib's <a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/manpages.html">manpages</a>.
</p><p>
OTP/Crypto requires that the user provides two or three items of information about the key. The application used
by the user is usually on a higher level, for example in
<a href="../ssl/ssl#type-key">SSL</a>. If using
the crypto application directly, it is required that:
</p><ul><li>an Engine is loaded, see the chapter on <a href="../crypto/engine_load#engine_load">Engine Load</a> or the <a href="../crypto/crypto#engine_load-3">Reference Manual</a> </li><li>a reference to a key in the Engine is available. This should be an Erlang string or binary and depends on the Engine loaded </li><li>an Erlang map is constructed with the Engine reference, the key reference and possibly a key passphrase if needed by the Engine. See the <a href="../crypto/crypto#type-engine_key_ref">Reference Manual</a> for details of the map. </li></ul><h2>Use Cases</h2><h2>Sign with an engine stored private key</h2><p>
This example shows how to construct a key reference that is used in a sign operation.
The actual key is stored in the engine that is loaded at prompt 1.
</p><pre><code class="">
1&gt; {ok, EngineRef} = crypto:engine_load(....).
...
{ok,#Ref&lt;0.2399045421.3028942852.173962&gt;}
2&gt; PrivKey = #{engine =&gt; EngineRef,
               key_id =&gt; "id of the private key in Engine"}.
...
3&gt; Signature = crypto:sign(rsa, sha, &lt;&lt;"The message"&gt;&gt;, PrivKey).

      </code></pre><h2>Verify with an engine stored public key</h2><p>
Here the signature and message in the last example is verifyed using the public key.
The public key is stored in an engine, only to exemplify that it is possible. The public
key could of course be handled openly as usual.
</p><pre><code class="">
4&gt; PublicKey = #{engine =&gt; EngineRef,
                 key_id =&gt; "id of the public key in Engine"}.
...
5&gt; crypto:verify(rsa, sha, &lt;&lt;"The message"&gt;&gt;, Signature, PublicKey).
true
6&gt; 
      </code></pre><h2>Using a password protected private key</h2><p>
The same example as the first sign example, except that a password protects the key down in the Engine.
</p><pre><code class="">
6&gt; PrivKeyPwd = #{engine =&gt; EngineRef,
                  key_id =&gt; "id of the pwd protected private key in Engine",
		  password =&gt; "password"}.
...
7&gt; crypto:sign(rsa, sha, &lt;&lt;"The message"&gt;&gt;, PrivKeyPwd).
