Fixes a bug that caused <strong>crypto:sign</strong> and
<strong>crypto:verify</strong> to return the error message
<strong>badarg</strong> instead of <strong>notsup</strong> in one case. That
case was when signing or verifying with eddsa keys (that
is, ed15519 or ed448), but only when FIPS was supported
and enabled.</p> <p>

The RSA options <strong>rsa_mgf1_md</strong>, <strong>rsa_oaep_md</strong>,
and <strong>rsa_oaep_label</strong> were always disabled. They will
now be enabled when a suitable cryptolib is used.</p> <p>
They are still experimental and may change without prior
notice.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15212 Aux Id: ERL-675, PR1899, PR838 </p> </li><li> <p>
The ciphers <strong>aes_ige256</strong> and <strong>blowfish_cbc</strong> had

Own Id: OTP-15286</p> </li></ul><h2>Crypto 4.3.2</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p> Update the crypto engine functions to handle multiple
loads of an engine. </p> <p><strong>engine_load/3/4</strong> is
updated so it doesn't add the engine ID to OpenSSLs
internal list of engines which makes it possible to run
the engine_load more than once if it doesn't contain
global data.</p> <p>Added <strong>ensure_engine_loaded/2/3</strong>
which guarantees that the engine just is loaded once and
the following calls just returns a reference to it. This
is done by add the ID to the internal OpenSSL list and
check if it is already registered when the function is
called.</p> <p>Added <strong>ensure_engine_unloaded/1/2</strong> to
unload engines loaded with ensure_engine_loaded.</p> <p>Then some more utility functions are added.</p> <p><strong>engine_add/1</strong>, adds the engine to OpenSSL
internal list</p> <p><strong>engine_remove/1</strong>, remove the
engine from OpenSSL internal list</p> <p><strong>engine_get_id/1</strong>, fetch the engines id</p> <p><strong>engine_get_name/1</strong>, fetch the engine name</p> <p>

Integrate elliptic curve contribution from Andreas
Schultz </p> <p>
In order to be able to support elliptic curve cipher
suites in SSL/TLS, additions to handle elliptic curve
infrastructure has been added to public_key and crypto.</p> <p>
This also has resulted in a rewrite of the crypto API to
gain consistency and remove unnecessary overhead. All OTP
applications using crypto has been updated to use the new
API.</p> <p>
Impact: Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) offers
equivalent security with smaller key sizes than other
public key algorithms. Smaller key sizes result in
savings for power, memory, bandwidth, and computational
cost that make ECC especially attractive for constrained
environments.</p> <p>

improvements.</p> <p>Most notable:</p> <ul><li> Lots of cross compilation improvements. The old cross compilation support was more or less non-existing as well as broken. Please, note that the cross compilation support should still be considered as experimental. Also note that old cross compilation configurations cannot be used without modifications. For more information on cross compiling Erlang/OTP see the <strong>$ERL_TOP/INSTALL-CROSS.md</strong> file. </li><li> Support for staged install using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/DESTDIR.html">DESTDIR</a>. The old broken <strong>INSTALL_PREFIX</strong> has also been fixed. For more information see the <strong>$ERL_TOP/INSTALL.md</strong> file. </li><li> Documentation of the <strong>release</strong> target of the top <strong>Makefile</strong>. For more information see the <strong>$ERL_TOP/INSTALL.md</strong> file. </li><li> <strong>make install</strong> now by default creates relative symbolic links instead of absolute ones. For more information see the <strong>$ERL_TOP/INSTALL.md</strong> file. </li><li> <strong>$ERL_TOP/configure --help=recursive</strong> now works and prints help for all applications with <strong>configure</strong> scripts. </li><li> Doing <strong>make install</strong>, or <strong>make release</strong> directly after <strong>make all</strong> no longer triggers miscellaneous rebuilds. </li><li> Existing bootstrap system is now used when doing <strong>make install</strong>, or <strong>make release</strong> without a preceding <strong>make all</strong>. </li><li> The <strong>crypto</strong> and <strong>ssl</strong> applications use the same runtime library path when dynamically linking against <strong>libssl.so</strong> and <strong>libcrypto.so</strong>. The runtime library search path has also been extended. </li><li> The <strong>configure</strong> scripts of <strong>erl_interface</strong> and <strong>odbc</strong> now search for thread libraries and thread library quirks the same way as ERTS do. </li><li> The <strong>configure</strong> script of the <strong>odbc</strong> application now also looks for odbc libraries in <strong>lib64</strong> and <strong>lib/64</strong> directories when building on a 64-bit system. </li><li> The <strong>config.h.in</strong> file in the <strong>erl_interface</strong> application is now automatically generated in instead of statically updated which reduces the risk of <strong>configure</strong> tests without any effect. </li></ul> <p>(Thanks to Henrik Riomar for suggestions and

crypto is used). Also corrected build problems on Mac OS
X.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5279</p> </li></ul><h2>Crypto 1.2.1</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>It was not possible in R9 to relink the crypto driver.
The object file was missing as well as an example
makefile. The crypto driver object file is now released
with the application (installed in priv/obj). An example
makefile has also been added to the priv/obj directory.

(crypto_drv.dll).</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-4828 Aux Id: seq8193 </p> </li></ul><h2>Crypto 1.2</h2><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>Previous versions of Crypto where delivered with
statically linked binaries based on SSLeay. That is not
longer the case.  The current version of Crypto requires
dynamically linked OpenSSL libraries that the user has to
install. The library needed is <strong>libcrypto.so</strong> (Unix)
or <strong>libeay32.[lib|dll]</strong> (Win32). For further details
see the crypto(6) application manual page.</p> </li><li> <p>This version of Crypto uses the new DES interface of
OpenSSL 0.9.7, which is not backward compatible with
earlier versions of OpenSSL.
</p> </li><li>The functions <strong>des_ede3_cbc_encrypt/5</strong> and <strong>des_ede3_cbc_decrypt/5</strong> have been renamed to <strong>des3_cbc_encrypt/5</strong> and <strong>des3_cbc_decrypt/5</strong>, respectively. The old functions have been retained (they are deprecated and not listed in the crypto(3) manual page).</li></ul><h2>Reported Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>The start of crypto failed on Windows, due to erroneous addition
