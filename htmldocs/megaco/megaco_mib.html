implementation is based on
<em>draft-ietf-megaco-mib-04.txt</em>.  Almost all of the mib
cannot easily be implemented by the megaco application. Instead
these things should be implemented by a user (of the megaco
application). </p><p>So what part of the mib is implemented? Basically the relevant
statistic counters of the <em>MedGwyGatewayStatsEntry</em>.</p><h2>Statistics counters</h2><p>The implementation of the statistic counters is
lightweight. I.e.  the statistic counters are handled
separately by different entities of the application. For
instance our two transport module(s) (see <a href="./megaco_tcp#stats">megaco_tcp</a> and <a href="./megaco_udp#stats">megaco_udp</a>) maintain their
own counters and the application engine (see <a href="./megaco#stats">megaco</a>) maintain its own
counters.</p><p>This also means that if a user implement their own transport
service then it has to maintain its own statistics.</p><h2>Distribution</h2><p>Each megaco application maintains its own set of counters. So
in a large (distributed) MG/MGC it could be necessary to
collect the statistics from several nodes (each) running the
megaco application (only one of them with the transport).</p></body></html>
