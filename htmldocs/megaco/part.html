applications on top of the Megaco/H.248 protocol. </p><p>Megaco/H.248 is a protocol for control of elements in a
physically decomposed multimedia gateway, enabling separation of
call control from media conversion. A Media Gateway Controller
(MGC) controls one or more Media Gateways (MG).</p><p>This version of the stack supports version 1, 2 and 3 as 
defined by:</p><ul><li> <p>version 1 - RFC 3525 and H.248-IG (v10-v13)</p> </li><li> <p>version 2 - draft-ietf-megaco-h248v2-04 &amp; H.248.1

the edge of the packet network. Examples of this is IP-PSTN trunking 
gateways and analog line gateways. The main function of Megaco is to 
allow gateway decomposition into a call agent (call control) part (known
as Media Gateway Controller, MGC) - master, and an gateway interface 
part (known as Media Gateway, MG) - slave. The MG has no call control 
knowledge and only handle making the connections and simple 
configurations.</p><p>SIP and H.323 are peer-to-peer protocols for call control (valid only 
for some of the protocols within H.323), or more generally multi-media 
session protocols. They both operate at a different level (call control) 
from Megaco in a decomposed network, and are therefor not aware of 
whether or not Megaco is being used underneath.</p><img src="megaco_sys_arch.gif" title="Network architecture"></img><p>Megaco and peer protocols are complementary in nature and entirely
compatible within the same system. At a system level, Megaco allows 
for</p><ul><li> <p>overall network cost and performance optimization</p> </li><li> <p>protection of investment by isolation of changes at the call 
control layer</p> </li><li> <p>freedom to geographically distribute both call function and 
gateway function</p> </li><li> <p>adaption of legacy equipment</p> </li></ul><h3>General</h3><p>This Erlang/OTP application supplies a framework for building
applications that needs to utilize the Megaco/H.248 protocol.</p><p>We have introduced the term "user" as a generic term for either
an MG or an MGC, since most of the functionality we support, is
common for both MG's and MGC's. A (local) user may be configured
in various ways and it may establish any number of connections
to its counterpart, the remote user. Once a connection has been
established, the connection is supervised and it may be used for
the purpose of sending messages. N.B. according to the standard
an MG is connected to at most one MGC, while an MGC may be
connected to any number of MG's.</p><p>For the purpose of managing "virtual MG's", one Erlang node may
host any number of MG's. In fact it may host a mix of MG's and
MGC's. You may say that an Erlang node may host any number of
"users".</p><p>The protocol engine uses callback modules to handle various
things:</p><ul><li> <p>encoding callback modules - handles the encoding and
decoding of messages. Several modules for handling different
encodings are included, such as ASN.1 BER, pretty well
indented text, compact text and some others. Others may be
written by you.</p> </li><li> <p>transport callback modules - handles sending and receiving
of messages. Transport modules for TCP/IP and UDP/IP are
included and others may be written by you.</p> </li><li> <p>user callback modules - the actual implementation of an MG
or MGC. Most of the functions are intended for handling of a
decoded transaction (request, reply, acknowledgement), but
there are others that handles connect, disconnect and
errors cases.</p> </li></ul><p>Each connection may have its own configuration of callback
modules, re-send timers, transaction id ranges etc. and they may
be re-configured on-the-fly.</p><p>In the API of Megaco, a user may explicitly send action
requests, but generation of transaction identifiers, the
encoding and actual transport of the message to the remote user
is handled automatically by the protocol engine according to the
actual connection configuration. Megaco messages are not exposed
in the API.</p><p>On the receiving side the transport module receives the message
and forwards it to the protocol engine, which decodes it and
invokes user callback functions for each transaction. When a
user has handled its action requests, it simply returns a list
of action replies (or a message error) and the protocol engine
uses the encoding module and transport module to compose and
forward the message to the originating user.</p><p>The protocol stack does also handle things like automatic
sending of acknowledgements, pending transactions, re-send of
messages, supervision of connections etc.</p><p>In order to provide a solution for scalable implementations of
MG's and MGC's, a user may be distributed over several Erlang
nodes. One of the Erlang nodes is connected to the physical
network interface, but messages may be sent from other nodes and
the replies are automatically forwarded back to the originating
node.</p><h3>Single node config</h3><p>Here a system configuration with an MG and MGC residing
in one Erlang node each is outlined:</p><img src="single_node_config.gif" title="Single node config"></img><h3>Distributed config</h3><p>In a larger system with a user (in this case an MGC)
distributed over several Erlang nodes, it looks a little bit
different. Here the encoding is performed on the originating
Erlang node (1) and the binary is forwarded to the node (2) with
the physical network interface. When the potential message reply
is received on the interface on node (2), it is decoded there
and then different actions will be taken for each transaction in
the message. The transaction reply will be forwarded in its
decoded form to the originating node (1) while the other types
of transactions will be handled locally on node (2).</p><p>Timers and re-send of messages will be handled on locally on
one node, that is node(1), in order to avoid unnecessary
transfer of data between the Erlang nodes.
</p><img src="distr_node_config.gif" title="Distributes node config"></img><h3>Message round-trip call flow</h3><p>The typical round-trip of a message can be viewed as
follows. Firstly we view the call flow on the originating
side:</p><img src="call_flow.gif" title="Message Call Flow (originating side)"></img><p>Then we continue with the call flow on the destination
side:</p><img src="call_flow_cont.gif" title="Message Call Flow (destination side)"></img><a name="starting"></a><h3>Starting</h3><p>A user may have a number of "virtual" connections to other
users. An MG is connected to at most one MGC, while an MGC may
be connected to any number of MG's. For each connection the user
selects a transport service, an encoding scheme and a user
callback module.</p><p>An MGC must initiate its transport service in order to listen
to MG's trying to connect. How the actual transport is initiated
is outside the scope of this application. However a send handle
(typically a socket id or host and port) must be provided from
the transport service in order to enable us to send the message
to the correct destination. We do however not assume anything
about this, from our point of view, opaque handle. Hopefully it
is rather small since it will passed around the system between
processes rather frequently.</p><p>A user may either be statically configured in a .config file
according to the application concept of Erlang/OTP or
dynamically started with the configuration settings as arguments
to megaco:start_user/2. These configuration settings may be
updated later on with megaco:update_conn_info/2.</p><p>The function megaco:connect/4 is used to tell the Megaco
application about which control process it should supervise,
which MID the remote user has, which callback module it should
use to send messages etc. When this "virtual" connection is
established the user may use megaco:call/3 and megaco:cast/3 in
order to send messages to the other side. Then it is up to the
MG to send its first Service Change Request message after
applying some clever algorithm in order to fight the problem
with startup avalanche (as discussed in the RFC).</p><p>The originating user will wait for a reply or a timeout
(defined by the request_timer). When it receives the reply this
will optionally be acknowledged (regulated by auto_ack), and
forwarded to the user.  If an interim pending reply is received,
the long_request_timer will be used instead of the usual
request_timer, in order to enable avoidance of spurious re-sends
of the request.</p><p>On the destination side the transport service waits for
messages. Each message is forwarded to the Megaco application
via the megaco:receive_message/4 callback function. The
transport service may or may not provide means for blocking and
unblocking the reception of the incoming messages.</p><p>If a message is received before the "virtual" connection has
been established, the connection will be setup automatically. An
MGC may be real open minded and dynamically decide which
encoding and transport service to use depending on how the
transport layer contact is performed. For IP transports two
ports are standardized, one for textual encoding and one for
binary encoding. If for example an UDP packet was received on
the text port it would be possible to decide encoding and
transport on the fly.</p><p>After decoding a message various user callback functions are
invoked in order to allow the user to act properly.  See the
megaco_user module for more info about the callback
arguments.</p><p>When the user has processed a transaction request in its
callback function, the Megaco application assembles a
transaction reply, encodes it using the selected encoding module
and sends the message back by invoking the callback
function:</p><ul><li> <p>SendMod:send_message(SendHandle, ErlangBinary)</p> </li></ul><p>Re-send of messages, handling pending transactions,
acknowledgements etc. is handled automatically by the Megaco
application but the user is free to override the default
behaviour by the various configuration possibilities. See
megaco:update_user_info/2 and megaco:update_conn_info/2 about
the possibilities.</p><p>When connections gets broken (that is explicitly by
megaco:disconnect/2 or when its controlling process dies) a user
callback function is invoked in order to allow the user to
re-establish the connection. The internal state of kept
messages, re-send timers etc. is not affected by this. A few
re-sends will of course fail while the connection is down, but
the automatic re-send algorithm does not bother about this and
eventually when the connection is up and running the messages
will be delivered if the timeouts are set to be long enough. The
user has the option of explicitly invoking megaco:cancel/2 to
cancel all messages for a connection.</p><a name="mgc_startup_call_flow"></a><h3>MGC startup call flow</h3><p>In order to prepare the MGC for the reception of the initial
message, hopefully a Service Change Request, the following needs
to be done:</p><ul><li> <p>Start the Megaco application.</p> </li><li> <p>Start the MGC user. This may either be done explicitly
with megaco:start_user/2 or implicitly by providing the -megaco
users configuration parameter.</p> </li><li> <p>Initiate the transport service and provide it with a
receive handle obtained from megaco:user_info/2.</p> </li></ul><p>When the initial message arrives the transport service
forwards it to the protocol engine which automatically
sets up the connection and invokes UserMod:handle_connect/2
before it invokes UserMod:handle_trans_request/3 with
the Service Change Request like this:</p><img src="MGC_startup_call_flow.gif" title="MGC Startup Call Flow"></img><a name="mg_startup_call_flow"></a><h3>MG startup call flow</h3><p>In order to prepare the MG for the sending of the initial
message, hopefully a Service Change Request, the following needs
to be done:</p><ul><li> <p>Start the Megaco application.</p> </li><li> <p>Start the MG user. This may either be done explicitly
with megaco:start_user/2 or implicitly by providing the -megaco
users configuration parameter.</p> </li><li> <p>Initiate the transport service and provide it with a
receive handle obtained from megaco:user_info/2.</p> </li><li> <p>Setup a connection to the MGC with megaco:connect/4 and
provide it with a receive handle obtained from
megaco:user_info/2.</p> </li></ul><p>If the MG has been provisioned with the MID of the MGC it can
be given as the RemoteMid parameter to megaco:connect/4 and the
call flow will look like this:</p><img src="MG_startup_call_flow.gif" title="MG Startup Call Flow"></img><p>If the MG cannot be provisioned with the MID of the MGC, the
MG can use the atom 'preliminary_mid' as the RemoteMid parameter
to megaco:connect/4 and the call flow will look like this:</p><img src="MG-startup_flow_noMID.gif" title="MG Startup Call Flow (no MID)"></img><a name="config_megaco"></a><h3>Configuring the Megaco stack</h3><p>There are three kinds of configuration:</p><ul><li> <p>User info - Information related to megaco users. Read/Write. </p> <p>A User is an entity identified by a MID, e.g. a MGC or a MG. </p> <p>This information can be retrieved using 
<a href="./megaco#user_info">megaco:user_info</a>. </p> </li><li> <p>Connection info - Information regarding connections. Read/Write.</p> <p>This information can be retrieved using 
<a href="./megaco#conn_info">megaco:conn_info</a>. </p> </li><li> <p>System info - System wide information. Read only.</p> <p>This information can be retrieved using 
<a href="./megaco#system_info">megaco:system_info</a>. </p> </li></ul><a name="initial_config"></a><h3>Initial configuration</h3><p>The initial configuration of the Megaco should be defined in the
Erlang system configuration file. The following configured parameters
are defined for the Megaco application:</p><ul><li> <p><strong>users = [{Mid, [user_config()]}].</strong></p> <p>Each user is represented by a tuple with the Mid of the user and a
list of config parameters (each parameter is in turn a tuple:
<strong>{Item, Value}</strong>).</p> </li><li> <p><strong>scanner = flex | {Module, Function, Arguments, Modules}</strong></p> <ul><li> <p><strong>flex</strong> will result in the start of the flex scanner with default 
options.</p> </li><li> <p>The MFA alternative makes it possible for Megaco to start and
supervise a scanner written by the user (see 
<strong>supervisor:start_child</strong> for an explanation of the 
parameters).</p> </li></ul> </li></ul><p>See also <a href="./megaco_encode#text_config">Configuration of text encoding module(s)</a> 
for more info. </p><a name="changing_config"></a><h3>Changing the configuration</h3><p>The configuration can be changed during runtime. This is done with
the functions <a href="./megaco#update_user_info">megaco:update_user_info</a> and 
<a href="./megaco#update_conn_info">megaco:update_conn_info</a></p><a name="transaction_sender"></a><h3>The transaction sender</h3><p>The transaction sender is a process (one per connection), which handle
all transaction sending, if so configured (see 
<a href="./megaco#user_info">megaco:user_info</a> and 
<a href="./megaco#conn_info">megaco:conn_info</a>).</p><p>The purpose of the transaction sender is to accumulate transactions 
for a more efficient message sending. The transactions that are 
accumulated are transaction request and transaction ack. For 
transaction ack's the benefit is quite large, since the transactions 
are small and it is possible to have ranges (which means that 
transaction acks for transactions 1, 2, 3 and 4 can be sent as a 
range 1-4 in one transaction ack, instead of four separate 
transactions). </p><p>There are a number of configuration parameter's that control the 
operation of the transaction sender. In principle, a message with 
everything stored (ack's and request's) is sent from the process 
when:</p><ul><li> <p>When <strong>trans_timer</strong> expires.</p> </li><li> <p>When <strong>trans_ack_maxcount</strong> number of ack's has been 
received.</p> </li><li> <p>When <strong>trans_req_maxcount</strong> number of requests's has 
been received.</p> </li><li> <p>When the size of all received requests exceeds 
<strong>trans_req_maxsize</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p>When a reply transaction is sent.</p> </li><li> <p>When a pending transaction is sent.</p> </li></ul><p>When something is to be sent, everything is packed into one message,  
unless the trigger was a reply transaction and the added size of the 
reply and all the requests is greater then 
<strong>trans_req_maxsize</strong>, in which case the stored 
transactions are sent first in a separate message and the reply in 
another message.</p><p>When the transaction sender receives a request which is already 
"in storage" (indicated by the transaction id) it is assumed to 
be a resend and everything stored is sent. This could happen if 
the values of the <strong>trans_timer</strong> and the
<strong>request_timer</strong> is not properly chosen.</p><a name="segment_reply"></a><h3>Segmentation of transaction replies</h3><p>In version 3 of the megaco standard the Segmentation package was
introduced. Simply, this package defines a procedure to segment 
megaco messages (transaction replies) when using a transport that 
does not automatically do this (e.g. UDP). See also
<a href="./megaco_encode#handling_versions">version3</a>.</p><p>Although it would be both pointless and counterproductive to use
segmentation on a transport that already does this (e.g. TCP), the 
megaco application does not check this. Instead, it is up to the 
user to configure this properly. </p><ul><li> <p>Receiving segmented messages: </p> <p>This is handled automatically by the megaco application. 
There is however one thing that need to be configured by the user, 
the 
<a href="./megaco#user_info">segment_recv_timer</a>
option. </p> <p>Note that the segments are delivered to the user differently 
depending on which function is used to issue the original request.
When issuing the request using the 
<a href="./megaco#cast">megaco:cast</a> function,
the segments are delivered to the user via the 
<a href="./megaco_user#trans_reply">handle_trans_reply</a>
callback function one at a time, as they arrive. But this obviously
doe not work for the 
<a href="./megaco#call">megaco:call</a> function. 
In this case, the segments are accumulated and then delivered
all at once as the function returns.</p> </li><li> <p>Sending segmented messages: </p> <p>This is also handled automatically by the megaco application. 
First of all, segmentation is only attempted if so configured, see 
the <a href="./megaco#user_info">segment_send</a> option.
Secondly, megaco relies on the ability of the used codec to
encode action replies, which is the smallest component the
megaco application handles when segmenting. Thirdly, the 
reply will be segmented only if the sum of the size of the
action replies (plus an arbitrary message header size) are greater
then the specified max message size (see the 
<a href="./megaco#user_info">max_pdu_size</a> option).
Finally, if segmentation is decided, then each action reply
will make up its own (segment) message.</p> </li></ul><p>This version of the stack is compliant with: </p><ul><li> <p>Megaco/H.248 version 1 (RFC3525)
updated according to Implementors Guide version 10-13.</p> </li><li> <p>Megaco/H.248 version 2 as defined by 
draft-ietf-megaco-h248v2-04
updated according to Implementors Guide version 10-13.</p> </li><li> <p>Megaco/H.248 version 3 as defined by 
ITU H.248.1 (09/2005).</p> </li></ul><h3>Internal form of messages</h3><p>We use the same internal form for both the binary and text
encoding.  Our internal form of Megaco/H.248 messages is heavily
influenced by the internal format used by ASN.1
encoders/decoders:</p><ul><li> <p>"SEQUENCE OF" is represented as a list.</p> </li><li> <p>"CHOICE" is represented as a tagged tuple with size 2.</p> </li><li> <p>"SEQUENCE" is represented as a record, defined in
"megaco/include/megaco_message_v1.hrl".</p> </li><li> <p>"OPTIONAL" is represented as an ordinary field in a
record which defaults to 'asn1_NOVALUE', meaning that the
field has no value.</p> </li><li> <p>"OCTET STRING" is represented as a list of unsigned integers.</p> </li><li> <p>"ENUMERATED" is represented as a single atom.</p> </li><li> <p>"BIT STRING" is represented as a list of atoms.</p> </li><li> <p>"BOOLEAN" is represented as the atom 'true' or 'false'.</p> </li><li> <p>"INTEGER" is represented as an integer.</p> </li><li> <p>"IA5String" is represented as a list of integers,
where each integer is the ASCII value of the corresponding
character.</p> </li><li> <p>"NULL" is represented as the atom 'NULL'.</p> </li></ul><p>In order to fully understand the internal form you must get
hold on a ASN.1 specification for the Megaco/H.248 protocol, 
and apply the rules above.
Please, see the documentation of the ASN.1 compiler in
Erlang/OTP for more details of the semantics in mapping between
ASN.1 and the corresponding internal form.</p><p>Observe that the 'TerminationId' record is not used in the
internal form. It has been replaced with a megaco_term_id record
(defined in "megaco/include/megaco.hrl").</p><h3>The different encodings</h3><p>The Megaco/H.248 standard defines both a plain text encoding
and a binary encoding (ASN.1 BER) and we have implemented
encoders and decoders for both. We do in fact supply five
different encoding/decoding modules.</p><p>In the text encoding, implementors have the choice of using a
mix of short and long keywords. It is also possible to add white
spaces to improve readability. We use the term compact for text
messages with the shortest possible keywords and no optional
white spaces, and the term pretty for a well indented text
format using long keywords and an indentation style like the
text examples in the Megaco/H.248 specification).</p><p>Here follows an example of a text message to give a feeling
of the difference between the pretty and compact versions of
text messages. First the pretty, well indented version with long
keywords:</p><pre>
   MEGACO/1 [124.124.124.222]
   Transaction = 9998 {
           Context = - {
                   ServiceChange = ROOT {
                           Services {
                                   Method = Restart,
                                   ServiceChangeAddress = 55555,
                                   Profile = ResGW/1,
                                   Reason = "901 Cold Boot"
                           }
                   }
           }
   }    </pre><p>Then the compact version without indentation and with short keywords:</p><pre>
 
   !/1 [124.124.124.222]
   T=9998{C=-{SC=ROOT{SV{MT=RS,AD=55555,PF=ResGW/1,RE="901 Cold Boot"}}}}    </pre><p>And the programmers view of the same message.
First a list of ActionRequest records are constructed and
then it is sent with one of the send functions in the API:</p><pre>
  Prof = #'ServiceChangeProfile'{profileName = "resgw", version = 1},
  Parm = #'ServiceChangeParm'{serviceChangeMethod  = restart,
                              serviceChangeAddress = {portNumber, 55555},
                              serviceChangeReason  = "901 Cold Boot",
                              serviceChangeProfile = Prof},
  Req = #'ServiceChangeRequest'{terminationID = [?megaco_root_termination_id],
                                serviceChangeParms = Parm},
  Actions = [#'ActionRequest'{contextId = ?megaco_null_context_id,
                              commandRequests = {serviceChangeReq, Req}}],
  megaco:call(ConnHandle, Actions, Config).    </pre><p>And finally a print-out of the entire internal form:</p><pre>

may be one of these:</p><ul><li> <p><strong>[]</strong> - Encodes the messages to the standard distribution
format. It is rather verbose but encoding and decoding is
blinding fast.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>[megaco_compressed]</strong> - Encodes the messages to the
standard distribution format after an internal transformation. 
It is less verbose, but the total time of the encoding and 
decoding will on the other hand be somewhat slower (see the 
<a href="megaco_performance">performance</a> 
chapter for more info).</p> </li><li> <p><strong>[{megaco_compressed, Module}]</strong> - Works in the same
way as the megaco_compressed config parameter, only here the 
user provide their own compress module. This module must 
implement the 
<a href="megaco_edist_compress">megaco_edist_compress</a> 
behaviour.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>[compressed]</strong> - Encodes the messages to a compressed
form of the standard distribution format. It is less
verbose, but the encoding and decoding will on the other
hand be slower.</p> </li></ul><a name="text_config"></a><h3>Configuration of text encoding module(s)</h3><p>When using text encoding(s), there is actually two different
configs controlling what software to use:</p><ul><li> <p><strong>[]</strong> - An empty list indicates that the erlang
scanner should be used.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>[{flex, port()}]</strong> - Use the flex scanner when 
decoding (not optimized for SMP). See 
<a href="./megaco_run#initial_config">initial configuration</a> 
for more info.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>[{flex, ports()}]</strong> - Use the flex scanner when 
decoding (optimized for SMP). See 
<a href="./megaco_run#initial_config">initial configuration</a> 
for more info.</p> </li></ul><p>The Flex scanner is a Megaco scanner written as a linked in driver 
(in C). There are two ways to get this working:</p><ul><li> <p>Let the Megaco stack start the flex scanner 
(load the driver).</p> <p>To make this happen the megaco stack has to be configured: </p> <ul><li> <p>Add the <strong>{scanner, flex}</strong> (or similar) directive to an 
Erlang system config file for the megaco app (see 
<a href="./megaco_run#initial_config">initial configuration</a> 
chapter for details). </p> </li><li> <p>Retrieve the encoding-config using the
<a href="./megaco#system_info">system_info</a> 
function (with <strong>Item = text_config</strong>). </p> </li><li> <p>Update the receive handle with the encoding-config 
(the <strong>encoding_config</strong> field). </p> </li></ul> <p>The benefit of this is that Megaco handles the starting, holding
and the supervision of the driver and port.</p> </li><li> <p>The Megaco client (user) starts the flex scanner (load the driver).</p> <p>When starting the flex scanner a port to the linked in driver is 
created. This port has to be owned by a process. This process must not
die. If it does the port will also terminate. Therefor:</p>  <ul><li> <p>Create a permanent process. Make sure this process is
supervised (so that if it does die, this will be noticed).</p> </li><li> <p>Let this process start the flex scanner by calling the 
<strong>megaco_flex_scanner:start/0,1</strong> function.</p> </li><li> <p>Retrieve the encoding-config and when initiating
the <strong>megaco_receive_handle</strong>, set the 
field <strong>encoding_config</strong> accordingly.</p> </li><li> <p>Pass the <strong>megaco_receive_handle</strong> to the 
transport module.</p> </li></ul> </li></ul><a name="binary_config"></a><h3>Configuration of binary encoding module(s)</h3><p>When using binary encoding, the structure of the termination id's 
needs to be specified.</p><ul><li> <p><strong>[native]</strong> - skips the transformation phase, i.e. 
the decoded message(s) will not be transformed into our internal
form.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>[integer()]</strong> - A list containing the size (the number 
of bits) of each level. Example: <strong>[3,8,5,8]</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>integer()</strong> - Number of one byte (8 bits) levels.
N.B. This is currently converted into the previous config. 
Example: <strong>3</strong> (<strong>[8,8,8]</strong>).</p> </li></ul><a name="handling_versions"></a><h3>Handling megaco versions</h3><p>Since the version 3 implemented, in this version of the Megaco 
application, is preliminary, it is necessary to have a way
to handle different version 3 implementations. For this reason
the encoding config option <strong>{version3, version3()}</strong> has been 
introduced. This option, if present, has to be <em>first</em> in the 
encoding config list. Version 1 and 2 codec's ignore this option, if 
found. </p><pre><code class="">
version3() -&gt; prev3a | prev3b | prev3c | v3    </code></pre><ul><li> <p><em>prev3a</em></p> <p>Preliminary version 3, based on TD-33</p> </li><li> <p><em>prev3b</em></p> <p>Preliminary version 3, based on TD-33, but text encoding 
updated with the final solution for priority in 
<strong>contextProperty</strong> (which is backward compatible with v2).</p> </li><li> <p><em>prev3c</em></p> <p>Preliminary version 3, based on the final version of the 
v3-standard, but <em>excluding</em> segments!</p> </li><li> <p><em>v3</em></p> <p>Full version 3. Including segmentation. This is the default
version 3 variant (i.e. if a version 3 messages is to be 
encoded/decoded and no version3 encoding config is found, 
then v3 is assumed).</p> </li></ul><p>There are two ways to handle the different megaco encoding versions.
Either using <em>dynamic version detection</em> (only valid for
for incoming messages) or by <em>explicit version</em> setting in 
the connection info.</p><p>For incoming messages:</p><ul><li> <p>Dynamic version detection</p> <p>Set the protocol version in the megaco_receive_handle to 
<strong>dynamic</strong> (this is the default).
<br/>This works for those codecs that support partial decode of the 
version, currently <em>text</em>, and ber_bin 
(<strong>megaco_binary_encoder</strong> and <strong>megaco_ber_bin_encoder</strong>). 
<br/>This way the decoder will detect which version is used and 
then use the proper decoder. </p> </li><li> <p>Explicit version</p> <p>Explicitly set the actual protocol version in the 
megaco_receive_handle.
<br/>Start with version 1. When the initial service change has been 
performed and version 2 has been negotiated, upgrade the 
megaco_receive_handle of the transport process (control_pid) to 
version 2.
See 
<a href="./megaco_tcp#upgrade_receive_handle">megaco_tcp</a>
and 
<a href="./megaco_udp#upgrade_receive_handle">megaco_udp</a>.
<br/>Note that if <strong>udp</strong> is used, the same transport process 
could be used for several connections. This could make upgrading 
impossible.
<br/>For codecs that does not support partial decode of the version, 
currently <strong>megaco_ber_encoder</strong>, <strong>megaco_per_encoder</strong>
and <strong>megaco_per_bin_encoder</strong>, <strong>dynamic</strong> will revert to 
version 1.</p> </li></ul><p>For outgoing messages:</p><ul><li> <p>Update the connection info protocol_version.</p> </li><li> <p>Override protocol version when sending a message by adding the
item <strong>{protocol_version, integer()}</strong> to the Options.
See 
<a href="./megaco#call">call</a> or
<a href="./megaco#cast">cast</a>.
<br/>Note that this does not effect the messages that are sent
autonomously by the stack. They use the protocol_version of the
connection info.</p> </li></ul><h3>Encoder callback functions</h3><p>The encoder callback interface is defined by the <strong>megaco_encoder</strong> 
behaviour, see <a href="megaco_encoder">megaco_encoder</a>.</p><h3>Callback interface</h3><p>The callback interface of the transport module contains several
functions. Some of which are mandatory while others are only
optional: </p><ul><li> <p><strong>send_message</strong> - Send a message. <em>Mandatory</em></p> </li><li> <p><strong>block</strong> - Block the transport. <em>Optional</em></p> <p>This function is usefull for flow control.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>unblock</strong> - Unblock the transport. <em>Optional</em></p> </li></ul><p>For more detail, see the 
<a href="megaco_transport">megaco_transport</a>
behaviour definition.</p><h3>Examples</h3><p>The Megaco/H.248 application contains implementations
for the two protocols specified by the Megaco/H.248 standard;
UDP, see <a href="megaco_udp">megaco_udp</a>, 
and TCP/TPKT, see <a href="megaco_tcp">megaco_tcp</a>. </p><h3>A simple Media Gateway Controller</h3><p>In megaco/examples/simple/megaco_simple_mgc.erl there is an
example of a simple MGC that listens on both text and binary
standard ports and is prepared to handle a Service Change
Request message to arrive either via TCP/IP or UDP/IP. Messages
received on the text port are decoded using a text decoder and
messages received on the binary port are decoded using a binary
decoder.</p><p>The Service Change Reply is encoded in the same way as the
request and sent back to the MG with the same transport
mechanism UDP/IP or TCP/IP.</p><p>After this initial service change message the connection
between the MG and MGC is fully established and supervised.</p><p>The MGC, with its four listeners, may be started with:</p><pre>
      cd megaco/examples/simple
      erl -pa ../../../megaco/ebin -s megaco_filter -s megaco
      megaco_simple_mgc:start().
    </pre><p>or simply 'gmake mgc'.</p><p>The -s megaco_filter option to erl implies, the event tracing
mechanism to be enabled and an interactive sequence chart tool
to be started. This may be quite useful in order to visualize
how your MGC interacts with the Megaco/H.248 protocol stack.</p><p>The event traces may alternatively be directed to a file for
later analyze. By default the event tracing is disabled, but it
may dynamically be enabled without any need for re-compilation
of the code.
</p><h3>A simple Media Gateway</h3><p>In megaco/examples/simple/megaco_simple_mg.erl there is an
example of a simple MG that connects to an MGC, sends a Service
Change Request and waits synchronously for a reply.</p><p>After this initial service change message the connection
between the MG and MGC is fully established and supervised.</p><p>Assuming that the MGC is started on the local host, four
different MG's, using text over TCP/IP, binary over TCP/IP, text
over UDP/IP and binary over UDP/IP may be started on the same
Erlang node with:</p><pre>
      cd megaco/examples/simple
      erl -pa ../../../megaco/ebin -s megaco_filter -s megaco
      megaco_simple_mg:start().
    </pre><p>or simply 'gmake mg'.</p><p>If you "only" want to start a single MG which tries to connect
an MG on a host named "baidarka", you may use one of these
functions (instead of the megaco_simple_mg:start/0 above):</p><pre>
      megaco_simple_mg:start_tcp_text("baidarka", []).
      megaco_simple_mg:start_tcp_binary("baidarka", []).
      megaco_simple_mg:start_udp_text("baidarka", []).
      megaco_simple_mg:start_udp_binary("baidarka", []).
    </pre><p>The -s megaco_filter option to erl implies, the event tracing
mechanism to be enabled and an interactive sequence chart tool
to be started. This may be quite useful in order to visualize
how your MG interacts with the Megaco/H.248 protocol stack.</p><p>The event traces may alternatively be directed to a file for
later analyze. By default the event tracing is disabled, but it
may dynamically be enabled without any need for re-compilation
of the code.
</p><h3>Intro</h3><p>The Megaco mib is as of yet not standardized and our
implementation is based on
<em>draft-ietf-megaco-mib-04.txt</em>.  Almost all of the mib
cannot easily be implemented by the megaco application. Instead
these things should be implemented by a user (of the megaco
application). </p><p>So what part of the mib is implemented? Basically the relevant
statistic counters of the <em>MedGwyGatewayStatsEntry</em>.</p><h3>Statistics counters</h3><p>The implementation of the statistic counters is
lightweight. I.e.  the statistic counters are handled
separately by different entities of the application. For
instance our two transport module(s) (see <a href="./megaco_tcp#stats">megaco_tcp</a> and <a href="./megaco_udp#stats">megaco_udp</a>) maintain their
own counters and the application engine (see <a href="./megaco#stats">megaco</a>) maintain its own
counters.</p><p>This also means that if a user implement their own transport
service then it has to maintain its own statistics.</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>Each megaco application maintains its own set of counters. So
in a large (distributed) MG/MGC it could be necessary to
collect the statistics from several nodes (each) running the
megaco application (only one of them with the transport).</p><h3>Comparison of encoder/decoders</h3><p>The Megaco/H.248 standard defines both a plain text encoding and a 
binary encoding (ASN.1 BER) and we have implemented encoders and 
decoders for both. We do supply a bunch of different encoding/decoding 
modules and the user may in fact implement their own (like our erl_dist 
module). Using a non-standard encoding format has its obvious drawbacks, 
but may be useful in some configurations.</p><p>We have made four different measurements of our Erlang/OTP 
implementation of the Megaco/H.248 protocol stack, in order to compare 
our different encoders/decoders. The result of each one is summarized 
in the table below.</p><p>The result above are the fastest 
of these configurations for each codec. The figures presented are 
the average of all used messages.</p><p>For comparison, also included are first, performance figures with
megaco (including the measurement software) and asn1 applications 
hipe-compiled (second figure in the time columns, note that per bin 
decode had some issues so those figures are not included), and second, 
performance figures where the flex driver was built as 
<strong>non-reentrant</strong> flex
(third figure in the time columns, 
only valid for text codecs using the flex-scanner, 
figures within parenthesis). </p><table class="table table-bordered table-hover table-striped"><caption>Codec performance</caption><tbody><tr><td><em>Codec and config</em></td><td><em>Size</em></td><td><em>Encode</em></td><td><em>Decode</em></td><td><em>Total</em></td></tr><tr><td>pretty</td><td>336</td><td>20 / 13</td><td>75 / 40</td><td>95 / 53</td></tr><tr><td>pretty [flex]</td><td>336</td><td>20 / 13 / 20</td><td>39 / 33 / 38</td><td>59 / 46 / 58</td></tr><tr><td>compact</td><td>181</td><td>17 / 10</td><td>62 / 35</td><td>79 / 45</td></tr><tr><td>compact [flex]</td><td>181</td><td>17 / 10 / 17</td><td>37 / 31 / 36</td><td>54 / 41 / 53</td></tr><tr><td>per bin</td><td>91</td><td>60 / 29</td><td>64 / -</td><td>124 / -</td></tr><tr><td>per bin [driver]</td><td>91</td><td>39 / 24</td><td>42 / 26</td><td>81 / 50</td></tr><tr><td>per bin [native]</td><td>91</td><td>45 / 21</td><td>48 / -</td><td>93 / -</td></tr><tr><td>per bin [driver,native]</td><td>91</td><td>25 / 15</td><td>27 / 18</td><td>52 / 33</td></tr><tr><td>ber bin</td><td>165</td><td>32 / 19</td><td>38 / 21</td><td>70 / 40</td></tr><tr><td>ber bin [driver]</td><td>165</td><td>32 / 19</td><td>33 / 20</td><td>65 / 39</td></tr><tr><td>ber bin [native]</td><td>165</td><td>17 / 11</td><td>25 / 13</td><td>42 / 24</td></tr><tr><td>ber bin [driver,native]</td><td>165</td><td>17 / 11</td><td>17 / 12</td><td>34 / 23</td></tr><tr><td>erl_dist</td><td>875</td><td>5  /  5</td><td>10 / 10</td><td>15 / 15</td></tr><tr><td>erl_dist [megaco_compressed]</td><td>405</td><td>6  / 4</td><td>7  / 4</td><td>13 / 8</td></tr><tr><td>erl_dist [compressed]</td><td>345</td><td>47 / 47</td><td>20 / 20</td><td>67 / 67</td></tr><tr><td>erl_dist [megaco_compressed,compressed]</td><td>200</td><td>34 / 33</td><td>11 /  9</td><td>45 / 42</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>System performance characteristics</h3><p>This is primarily a way to show the effects of using the 
reentrant flex scanner instead of the non-reentrant. </p><p>As can be seen from the figures above there is no real difference 
between a non-reentrant and an reentrant flex scanner when it 
comes to the decode times of an individual message. </p><p>The real difference is instead in system characteristics, which 
is best shown with the mstone1 test. </p><p>When running SMP erlang on a multi-core machine the "throughput"
is significantly higher. The mstone1 test is an extreme test,
but it shows what is gained by using the reentrant flex-scanner. </p><img src="mstone1.jpg" title="MStone1 with mstone1.sh -d flex -s 4"></img><h3>Description of encoders/decoders</h3><p>In Appendix A of the Megaco/H.248 specification (RFC 3525), there are 
about 30 messages that shows a representative call flow. We have also 
added a few extra version 1, version 2 and version 3 messages. 
We have used these messages as basis for our measurements. 
Our figures have not been weighted in regard to how frequent 
the different kinds of messages that are sent between the media 
gateway and its controller.</p><p>The test compares the following encoder/decoders:</p><ul><li> <p><em>pretty</em> - pretty printed text. In the text encoding, 
the protocol stack implementors have the choice of using a 
mix of short and long keywords. It is also possible to add 
white spaces to improve readability. The pretty text encoding 
utilizes long keywords and an indentation style like the 
text examples in the Megaco/H.248 specification.</p> </li><li> <p><em>compact</em> - the compact text encoding uses the shortest 
possible keywords and no optional white spaces.</p> </li><li> <p><em>ber</em> - ASN.1 BER.</p> </li><li> <p><em>per</em> - ASN.1 PER. Not standardized as a valid 
Megaco/H.248 encoding, but included for the matter of completeness 
as its encoding is extremely compact.</p> </li><li> <p><em>erl_dist</em> - Erlang's native distribution format. Not 
standardized as a valid Megaco/H.248 encoding, but included 
as a reference due to its well known performance characteristics. 
Erlang is a dynamically typed language and any Erlang data 
structure may be serialized to the erl_dist format by using 
built-in functions.</p> </li></ul><p>The actual encoded messages have been collected in one directory per 
encoding type, containing one file per encoded message.</p><p>Here follows an example of a text message to give a feeling of the 
difference between the pretty and compact versions of text messages. 
First the pretty printed, well indented version with long keywords:</p><pre>
MEGACO/1 [124.124.124.222] 
  Transaction = 9998 { 
    Context = - { 
      ServiceChange = ROOT { 
        Services { 
          Method = Restart, 
          ServiceChangeAddress = 55555, 
          Profile = ResGW/1, 
          Reason = "901 MG Cold Boot"
        }
      }  
    }
  }    </pre><p>Then the compact text version without indentation and with short 
keywords:</p><pre>
!/1 [124.124.124.222] T=9998{
  C=-{SC=ROOT{SV{MT=RS,AD=55555,PF=ResGW/1,RE="901 MG Cold Boot"}}}}    </pre><h3>Setup</h3><p>The measurements has been performed on a 
HP xw4600 Workstation with 
a Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad CPU Q9550 @ 2.83GHz, with 4 GB memory and 
running Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64, kernel 2.6.32-22-generic. 
Software versions was open source OTP R13B04 (megaco-3.14).</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>In our measurements we have seen that there are no significant 
differences in message sizes between ASN.1 BER and the compact 
text format. Some care should be taken when using the pretty text 
style (which is used in all the examples included in the protocol 
specification and preferred during debugging sessions) since the 
messages can then be quite large. If the message size really is a 
serious issue, our per encoder should be used, as the ASN.1 PER 
format is much more compact than all the other alternatives. Its 
major drawback is that it is has not been approved as a valid 
Megaco/H.248 message encoding.</p><p>When it comes to pure encode/decode performance, it turns out that:</p><ul><li> <p>our fastest binary encoder (ber) is about equal 
to our fastest text encoder (compact). </p> </li><li> <p>our fastest binary decoder (ber) is about 54% (61%) faster than our 
fastest text decoder (compact). </p> </li></ul><p>If the pure encode/decode performance really is a serious issue, our 
erl_dist encoder could be used, as the encoding/decoding of the 
erlang distribution format is much faster than all the other 
alternatives. Its major drawback is that it is has not been approved 
as a valid Megaco/H.248 message encoding.</p><p>There is no performance advantage of building (and using) a 
non-reentrant flex scanner over a reentrant flex scanner (if flex
supports building such a scanner). </p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>Please, observe that these performance figures are related to our 
implementation in Erlang/OTP. Measurements of other implementations 
using other tools and techniques may of course result in other 
figures. </p></div><h3>Tracing</h3><p>We have instrumented our code in order to enable
tracing. Running the application with tracing deactivated,
causes a negligible performance overhead (an external call to a
function which returns an atom). Activation of tracing does not
require any recompilation of the code, since we rely on
Erlang/OTP's built in support for dynamic trace activation. In
our case tracing of calls to a given external function.</p><p>Event traces can be viewed in a generic message sequence chart
tool, <strong>et</strong>, or as standard output (events are written to stdio). </p><p>See <a href="./megaco#enable_trace">enable_trace</a>, 
<a href="./megaco#disable_trace">disable_trace</a> and
<a href="./megaco#set_trace">set_trace</a> for
more info. </p><h3>Measurement and transformation</h3><p>We have included some simple tool(s) for codec measurement (meas),
performance tests (mstone1 and mstone2) and message transformation.</p><p>The tool(s) are located in the example/meas directory.</p><h3>Requirement</h3><ul><li> <p>Erlang/OTP, version R13B01 or later.</p> </li><li> <p>Version 3.11 or later of <em>this</em> application.</p> </li><li> <p>Version 1.6.10 or later of the <em>asn1</em> application. </p> </li><li> <p>The flex libraries. Without it, the flex powered codecs cannot 
be used.</p> </li></ul><h3>Meas results</h3><p>The results from the measurement run (meas) is four 
excel-compatible textfiles: </p><ul><li> <p>decode_time.xls  -&gt; Decoding result</p> </li><li> <p>encode_time.xls  -&gt; Encoding result</p> </li><li> <p>total_time.xls   -&gt; Total (Decoding+encoding) result</p> </li><li> <p>message_size.xls -&gt; Message size</p> </li></ul><h3>Instruction</h3><p>The tool contain four things:
</p><ul><li> <p>The transformation module</p> </li><li> <p>The measurement (meas) module(s)</p> </li><li> <p>The mstone (mstone1 and mstone2) module(s)</p> </li><li> <p>The basic message file</p> </li></ul><h3>Message Transformation</h3><p>The messages used by the different tools are contained in 
single message package file (see below for more info). The messages
in this file is encoded with just one codec. During 
measurement initiation, the messages are read and then transformed to all
codec formats used in the measurement. </p><p>The message transformation is done by the transformation module.
It is used to transform a set of messages encoded with one codec 
into the other base codec's.</p><h3>Measurement(s)</h3><p>There are two different measurement tools: </p><ul><li> <p><em>meas</em>: </p> <p>Used to perform codec measurements. That is, to see what 
kind of performance can be expected by the different codecs 
provided by the megaco application. </p> <p>The measurement is done by iterating over the decode/encode 
function for approx 2 seconds per message and counting 
the number of decodes/encodes.</p> <p>Is best run by modifying the meas.sh.skel skeleton script
provided by the tool.</p> <p>To run it manually do the following: </p> <pre><code class="">

        1&gt; megaco_codec_meas:start().
        ...
        2&gt; halt().
        </code></pre> <p>or to make it even easier, assuming a measure shall be 
done on all the codecs (as above):</p> <pre><code class="">
        % erl -noshell -pa &lt;path-megaco-ebin-dir&gt; \\
              -pa &lt;path-to-meas-module-dir&gt; \\
              -s megaco_codec_meas -s init stop
        </code></pre> <p>When run as above (this will take some time), the measurement 
process is done as follows:</p> <pre>
For each codec:
    For each message:
        Read the message from the file
            Detect message version
            Measure decode
                Measure encode
          Write results, encode, decode and total, to file
        </pre> </li><li> <p><em>mstone1 and mstone2</em>: </p> <p>These are two different SMP performance monitoring tool(s). </p> <p><em>mstone1</em> creates a process for each codec config supported by 
the megaco application and let them run for a specific 
time (all at the same time), encoding and decoding 
megaco messages. The number of messages processed in total 
is the mstone1(1) value. </p> <p>There are different ways to run the mstone1 tool, e.g. with or without 
the use of drivers, with <em>only</em> flex-empowered configs. </p> <p>Is best run by modifying the mstone1.sh.skel skeleton script
provided by the tool.</p> <p>The <em>mstone2</em> is similar to the <em>mstone1</em> tool,
but in this case, each created process makes only <em>one</em> run 
through the messages and then exits. A soon as a process exits,
a new process (with the same config and messages) is created to takes 
its place. 
The number of messages processed in total 
is the mstone2(1) value. </p> </li></ul><p>Both these tools use the message package (time_test.msgs) provided
with the tool(s), although it can run on any message package as long as
it has the same structure. </p><h3>Message package file</h3><p>This is simply an erlang compatible text-file with the following 
structure: <strong>{codec_name(), messages_list()}</strong>. </p><pre>
codec_name() = pretty | compact | ber | per | erlang      (how the messages are encoded)
messages_list() = [{message_name(), message()}]
message_name() = atom()
message() = binary()
</pre><p>The codec name is the name of the codec with which all messages in
the <strong>message_list()</strong> has been encoded. </p><p>This file can be <strong>exported</strong> to a file structure by calling the 
<a href="./megaco_codec_transform#export_messages">export_messages</a>
function. This can be usefull if a measurement shall be done with
an external tool. Exporting the messages creates a directory tree 
with the following structure:
</p><pre><code class="">
&lt;message package&gt;/pretty/&lt;message-files&gt;
                  compact/
                  per/
                  ber/&lt;message-files&gt;
                  erlang/
        </code></pre><p>The file includes both version 1, 2 and version 3 messages.</p><h3>Notes</h3><h3>Binary codecs</h3><p>There are two basic ways to use the binary encodings: 
With package related name and termination id transformation
(the 'native' encoding config) or without. This transformation 
converts package related names and termination id's to a more 
convenient internal form (equivalent with the decoded text message).</p><p>The transformation is done _after_ the actual decode has been 
done.</p><p>Furthermore, it is possible to make use of a linked in driver that 
performs some of the decode/encode, decode for ber and encode for per 
(the 'driver' encoding config).</p><p>Therefor in the tests, binary codecs are tested with four 
different encoding configs to determine exactly how the
different options effect the performance: with transformation and 
without driver ([]), without transformation and without driver 
([native]), with transformation and with driver ([driver]) and 
finally without transformation and with driver ([driver,native]).</p><h3>Included test messages</h3><p>Some of these messages are ripped from the call flow examples 
in an old version of the RFC and others are created to test
a specific feature of megaco. </p><h3>Measurement tool directory name</h3><p>Be sure <em>not</em> no name the directory containing the measurement
binaries starting with 'megaco-', e.g. megaco-meas. This will
confuse the erlang application loader (erlang applications
are named, e.g. megaco-1.0.2).</p></body></html>
