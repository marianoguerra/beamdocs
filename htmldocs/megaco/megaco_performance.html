binary encoding (ASN.1 BER) and we have implemented encoders and 
decoders for both. We do supply a bunch of different encoding/decoding 
modules and the user may in fact implement their own (like our erl_dist 
module). Using a non-standard encoding format has its obvious drawbacks, 
but may be useful in some configurations.</p><p>We have made four different measurements of our Erlang/OTP 
implementation of the Megaco/H.248 protocol stack, in order to compare 
our different encoders/decoders. The result of each one is summarized 
in the table below.</p><p>The result above are the fastest 
of these configurations for each codec. The figures presented are 
the average of all used messages.</p><p>For comparison, also included are first, performance figures with
megaco (including the measurement software) and asn1 applications 
hipe-compiled (second figure in the time columns, note that per bin 
decode had some issues so those figures are not included), and second, 
performance figures where the flex driver was built as 
<strong>non-reentrant</strong> flex
(third figure in the time columns, 
only valid for text codecs using the flex-scanner, 
figures within parenthesis). </p><table class="table table-bordered table-hover table-striped"><caption>Codec performance</caption><tbody><tr><td><em>Codec and config</em></td><td><em>Size</em></td><td><em>Encode</em></td><td><em>Decode</em></td><td><em>Total</em></td></tr><tr><td>pretty</td><td>336</td><td>20 / 13</td><td>75 / 40</td><td>95 / 53</td></tr><tr><td>pretty [flex]</td><td>336</td><td>20 / 13 / 20</td><td>39 / 33 / 38</td><td>59 / 46 / 58</td></tr><tr><td>compact</td><td>181</td><td>17 / 10</td><td>62 / 35</td><td>79 / 45</td></tr><tr><td>compact [flex]</td><td>181</td><td>17 / 10 / 17</td><td>37 / 31 / 36</td><td>54 / 41 / 53</td></tr><tr><td>per bin</td><td>91</td><td>60 / 29</td><td>64 / -</td><td>124 / -</td></tr><tr><td>per bin [driver]</td><td>91</td><td>39 / 24</td><td>42 / 26</td><td>81 / 50</td></tr><tr><td>per bin [native]</td><td>91</td><td>45 / 21</td><td>48 / -</td><td>93 / -</td></tr><tr><td>per bin [driver,native]</td><td>91</td><td>25 / 15</td><td>27 / 18</td><td>52 / 33</td></tr><tr><td>ber bin</td><td>165</td><td>32 / 19</td><td>38 / 21</td><td>70 / 40</td></tr><tr><td>ber bin [driver]</td><td>165</td><td>32 / 19</td><td>33 / 20</td><td>65 / 39</td></tr><tr><td>ber bin [native]</td><td>165</td><td>17 / 11</td><td>25 / 13</td><td>42 / 24</td></tr><tr><td>ber bin [driver,native]</td><td>165</td><td>17 / 11</td><td>17 / 12</td><td>34 / 23</td></tr><tr><td>erl_dist</td><td>875</td><td>5  /  5</td><td>10 / 10</td><td>15 / 15</td></tr><tr><td>erl_dist [megaco_compressed]</td><td>405</td><td>6  / 4</td><td>7  / 4</td><td>13 / 8</td></tr><tr><td>erl_dist [compressed]</td><td>345</td><td>47 / 47</td><td>20 / 20</td><td>67 / 67</td></tr><tr><td>erl_dist [megaco_compressed,compressed]</td><td>200</td><td>34 / 33</td><td>11 /  9</td><td>45 / 42</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>System performance characteristics</h2><p>This is primarily a way to show the effects of using the 
reentrant flex scanner instead of the non-reentrant. </p><p>As can be seen from the figures above there is no real difference 
between a non-reentrant and an reentrant flex scanner when it 
comes to the decode times of an individual message. </p><p>The real difference is instead in system characteristics, which 
is best shown with the mstone1 test. </p><p>When running SMP erlang on a multi-core machine the "throughput"
is significantly higher. The mstone1 test is an extreme test,
but it shows what is gained by using the reentrant flex-scanner. </p><img src="mstone1.jpg" title="MStone1 with mstone1.sh -d flex -s 4"></img><h2>Description of encoders/decoders</h2><p>In Appendix A of the Megaco/H.248 specification (RFC 3525), there are 
about 30 messages that shows a representative call flow. We have also 
added a few extra version 1, version 2 and version 3 messages. 
We have used these messages as basis for our measurements. 
Our figures have not been weighted in regard to how frequent 
the different kinds of messages that are sent between the media 
gateway and its controller.</p><p>The test compares the following encoder/decoders:</p><ul><li> <p><em>pretty</em> - pretty printed text. In the text encoding, 
the protocol stack implementors have the choice of using a 
mix of short and long keywords. It is also possible to add 
white spaces to improve readability. The pretty text encoding 
utilizes long keywords and an indentation style like the 
text examples in the Megaco/H.248 specification.</p> </li><li> <p><em>compact</em> - the compact text encoding uses the shortest 
possible keywords and no optional white spaces.</p> </li><li> <p><em>ber</em> - ASN.1 BER.</p> </li><li> <p><em>per</em> - ASN.1 PER. Not standardized as a valid 
Megaco/H.248 encoding, but included for the matter of completeness 
as its encoding is extremely compact.</p> </li><li> <p><em>erl_dist</em> - Erlang's native distribution format. Not 
standardized as a valid Megaco/H.248 encoding, but included 
as a reference due to its well known performance characteristics. 
Erlang is a dynamically typed language and any Erlang data 
structure may be serialized to the erl_dist format by using 
built-in functions.</p> </li></ul><p>The actual encoded messages have been collected in one directory per 
encoding type, containing one file per encoded message.</p><p>Here follows an example of a text message to give a feeling of the 
difference between the pretty and compact versions of text messages. 
First the pretty printed, well indented version with long keywords:</p><pre>
MEGACO/1 [124.124.124.222] 
  Transaction = 9998 { 
    Context = - { 
      ServiceChange = ROOT { 
        Services { 
          Method = Restart, 
          ServiceChangeAddress = 55555, 
          Profile = ResGW/1, 
          Reason = "901 MG Cold Boot"
        }
      }  
    }
  }    </pre><p>Then the compact text version without indentation and with short 
keywords:</p><pre>
!/1 [124.124.124.222] T=9998{
  C=-{SC=ROOT{SV{MT=RS,AD=55555,PF=ResGW/1,RE="901 MG Cold Boot"}}}}    </pre><h2>Setup</h2><p>The measurements has been performed on a 
HP xw4600 Workstation with 
a Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad CPU Q9550 @ 2.83GHz, with 4 GB memory and 
running Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64, kernel 2.6.32-22-generic. 
Software versions was open source OTP R13B04 (megaco-3.14).</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>In our measurements we have seen that there are no significant 
differences in message sizes between ASN.1 BER and the compact 
text format. Some care should be taken when using the pretty text 
style (which is used in all the examples included in the protocol 
specification and preferred during debugging sessions) since the 
messages can then be quite large. If the message size really is a 
serious issue, our per encoder should be used, as the ASN.1 PER 
format is much more compact than all the other alternatives. Its 
major drawback is that it is has not been approved as a valid 
Megaco/H.248 message encoding.</p><p>When it comes to pure encode/decode performance, it turns out that:</p><ul><li> <p>our fastest binary encoder (ber) is about equal 
to our fastest text encoder (compact). </p> </li><li> <p>our fastest binary decoder (ber) is about 54% (61%) faster than our 
fastest text decoder (compact). </p> </li></ul><p>If the pure encode/decode performance really is a serious issue, our 
erl_dist encoder could be used, as the encoding/decoding of the 
erlang distribution format is much faster than all the other 
alternatives. Its major drawback is that it is has not been approved 
as a valid Megaco/H.248 message encoding.</p><p>There is no performance advantage of building (and using) a 
non-reentrant flex scanner over a reentrant flex scanner (if flex
supports building such a scanner). </p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>Please, observe that these performance figures are related to our 
implementation in Erlang/OTP. Measurements of other implementations 
using other tools and techniques may of course result in other 
figures. </p></div></body></html>
