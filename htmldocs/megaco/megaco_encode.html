updated according to Implementors Guide version 10-13.</p> </li><li> <p>Megaco/H.248 version 2 as defined by 
draft-ietf-megaco-h248v2-04
updated according to Implementors Guide version 10-13.</p> </li><li> <p>Megaco/H.248 version 3 as defined by 
ITU H.248.1 (09/2005).</p> </li></ul><h2>Internal form of messages</h2><p>We use the same internal form for both the binary and text
encoding.  Our internal form of Megaco/H.248 messages is heavily
influenced by the internal format used by ASN.1
encoders/decoders:</p><ul><li> <p>"SEQUENCE OF" is represented as a list.</p> </li><li> <p>"CHOICE" is represented as a tagged tuple with size 2.</p> </li><li> <p>"SEQUENCE" is represented as a record, defined in
"megaco/include/megaco_message_v1.hrl".</p> </li><li> <p>"OPTIONAL" is represented as an ordinary field in a
record which defaults to 'asn1_NOVALUE', meaning that the
field has no value.</p> </li><li> <p>"OCTET STRING" is represented as a list of unsigned integers.</p> </li><li> <p>"ENUMERATED" is represented as a single atom.</p> </li><li> <p>"BIT STRING" is represented as a list of atoms.</p> </li><li> <p>"BOOLEAN" is represented as the atom 'true' or 'false'.</p> </li><li> <p>"INTEGER" is represented as an integer.</p> </li><li> <p>"IA5String" is represented as a list of integers,
where each integer is the ASCII value of the corresponding
character.</p> </li><li> <p>"NULL" is represented as the atom 'NULL'.</p> </li></ul><p>In order to fully understand the internal form you must get
hold on a ASN.1 specification for the Megaco/H.248 protocol, 
and apply the rules above.
Please, see the documentation of the ASN.1 compiler in
Erlang/OTP for more details of the semantics in mapping between
ASN.1 and the corresponding internal form.</p><p>Observe that the 'TerminationId' record is not used in the
internal form. It has been replaced with a megaco_term_id record
(defined in "megaco/include/megaco.hrl").</p><h2>The different encodings</h2><p>The Megaco/H.248 standard defines both a plain text encoding
and a binary encoding (ASN.1 BER) and we have implemented
encoders and decoders for both. We do in fact supply five
different encoding/decoding modules.</p><p>In the text encoding, implementors have the choice of using a
mix of short and long keywords. It is also possible to add white
spaces to improve readability. We use the term compact for text
messages with the shortest possible keywords and no optional
white spaces, and the term pretty for a well indented text
format using long keywords and an indentation style like the
text examples in the Megaco/H.248 specification).</p><p>Here follows an example of a text message to give a feeling
of the difference between the pretty and compact versions of
text messages. First the pretty, well indented version with long
keywords:</p><pre>
   MEGACO/1 [124.124.124.222]
   Transaction = 9998 {
           Context = - {
                   ServiceChange = ROOT {
                           Services {
                                   Method = Restart,
                                   ServiceChangeAddress = 55555,
                                   Profile = ResGW/1,
                                   Reason = "901 Cold Boot"
                           }
                   }
           }
   }    </pre><p>Then the compact version without indentation and with short keywords:</p><pre>
 
   !/1 [124.124.124.222]
   T=9998{C=-{SC=ROOT{SV{MT=RS,AD=55555,PF=ResGW/1,RE="901 Cold Boot"}}}}    </pre><p>And the programmers view of the same message.
First a list of ActionRequest records are constructed and
then it is sent with one of the send functions in the API:</p><pre>
  Prof = #'ServiceChangeProfile'{profileName = "resgw", version = 1},
  Parm = #'ServiceChangeParm'{serviceChangeMethod  = restart,
                              serviceChangeAddress = {portNumber, 55555},
                              serviceChangeReason  = "901 Cold Boot",
                              serviceChangeProfile = Prof},
  Req = #'ServiceChangeRequest'{terminationID = [?megaco_root_termination_id],
                                serviceChangeParms = Parm},
  Actions = [#'ActionRequest'{contextId = ?megaco_null_context_id,
                              commandRequests = {serviceChangeReq, Req}}],
  megaco:call(ConnHandle, Actions, Config).    </pre><p>And finally a print-out of the entire internal form:</p><pre>

</p><ul><li> <p>megaco_pretty_text_encoder - encodes messages into
pretty text format, decodes both pretty as well as compact
text.</p> </li><li> <p>megaco_compact_text_encoder - encodes messages into
compact text format, decodes both pretty as well as compact
text.</p> </li><li> <p>megaco_binary_encoder - encode/decode ASN.1 BER messages.
This encoder implements the fastest of the BER encoders/decoders.
Recommended binary codec.</p> </li><li> <p>megaco_ber_encoder - encode/decode ASN.1 BER 
messages.</p> </li><li> <p>megaco_per_encoder - encode/decode ASN.1 PER
messages. N.B. that this format is not included in the
Megaco standard.</p> </li><li> <p>megaco_erl_dist_encoder - encodes messages into Erlangs
distribution format. It is rather verbose but encoding and
decoding is blinding fast. N.B. that this format is not 
included in the Megaco standard.</p> </li></ul><a name="erl_dist_config"></a><h2>Configuration of Erlang distribution encoding module</h2><p>The encoding_config of the megaco_erl_dist_encoder module
may be one of these:</p><ul><li> <p><strong>[]</strong> - Encodes the messages to the standard distribution
format. It is rather verbose but encoding and decoding is
blinding fast.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>[megaco_compressed]</strong> - Encodes the messages to the
standard distribution format after an internal transformation. 
It is less verbose, but the total time of the encoding and 
decoding will on the other hand be somewhat slower (see the 
<a href="megaco_performance">performance</a> 
chapter for more info).</p> </li><li> <p><strong>[{megaco_compressed, Module}]</strong> - Works in the same
way as the megaco_compressed config parameter, only here the 
user provide their own compress module. This module must 
implement the 
<a href="megaco_edist_compress">megaco_edist_compress</a> 
behaviour.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>[compressed]</strong> - Encodes the messages to a compressed
form of the standard distribution format. It is less
verbose, but the encoding and decoding will on the other
hand be slower.</p> </li></ul><a name="text_config"></a><h2>Configuration of text encoding module(s)</h2><p>When using text encoding(s), there is actually two different
configs controlling what software to use:</p><ul><li> <p><strong>[]</strong> - An empty list indicates that the erlang
scanner should be used.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>[{flex, port()}]</strong> - Use the flex scanner when 
decoding (not optimized for SMP). See 
<a href="./megaco_run#initial_config">initial configuration</a> 
for more info.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>[{flex, ports()}]</strong> - Use the flex scanner when 
decoding (optimized for SMP). See 
<a href="./megaco_run#initial_config">initial configuration</a> 
for more info.</p> </li></ul><p>The Flex scanner is a Megaco scanner written as a linked in driver 
(in C). There are two ways to get this working:</p><ul><li> <p>Let the Megaco stack start the flex scanner 
(load the driver).</p> <p>To make this happen the megaco stack has to be configured: </p> <ul><li> <p>Add the <strong>{scanner, flex}</strong> (or similar) directive to an 
Erlang system config file for the megaco app (see 
<a href="./megaco_run#initial_config">initial configuration</a> 
chapter for details). </p> </li><li> <p>Retrieve the encoding-config using the
<a href="./megaco#system_info">system_info</a> 
function (with <strong>Item = text_config</strong>). </p> </li><li> <p>Update the receive handle with the encoding-config 
(the <strong>encoding_config</strong> field). </p> </li></ul> <p>The benefit of this is that Megaco handles the starting, holding
and the supervision of the driver and port.</p> </li><li> <p>The Megaco client (user) starts the flex scanner (load the driver).</p> <p>When starting the flex scanner a port to the linked in driver is 
created. This port has to be owned by a process. This process must not
die. If it does the port will also terminate. Therefor:</p>  <ul><li> <p>Create a permanent process. Make sure this process is
supervised (so that if it does die, this will be noticed).</p> </li><li> <p>Let this process start the flex scanner by calling the 
<strong>megaco_flex_scanner:start/0,1</strong> function.</p> </li><li> <p>Retrieve the encoding-config and when initiating
the <strong>megaco_receive_handle</strong>, set the 
field <strong>encoding_config</strong> accordingly.</p> </li><li> <p>Pass the <strong>megaco_receive_handle</strong> to the 
transport module.</p> </li></ul> </li></ul><a name="binary_config"></a><h2>Configuration of binary encoding module(s)</h2><p>When using binary encoding, the structure of the termination id's 
needs to be specified.</p><ul><li> <p><strong>[native]</strong> - skips the transformation phase, i.e. 
the decoded message(s) will not be transformed into our internal
form.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>[integer()]</strong> - A list containing the size (the number 
of bits) of each level. Example: <strong>[3,8,5,8]</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>integer()</strong> - Number of one byte (8 bits) levels.
N.B. This is currently converted into the previous config. 
Example: <strong>3</strong> (<strong>[8,8,8]</strong>).</p> </li></ul><a name="handling_versions"></a><h2>Handling megaco versions</h2><p>Since the version 3 implemented, in this version of the Megaco 
application, is preliminary, it is necessary to have a way
to handle different version 3 implementations. For this reason
the encoding config option <strong>{version3, version3()}</strong> has been 
introduced. This option, if present, has to be <em>first</em> in the 
encoding config list. Version 1 and 2 codec's ignore this option, if 
found. </p><pre><code class="">
version3() -&gt; prev3a | prev3b | prev3c | v3    </code></pre><ul><li> <p><em>prev3a</em></p> <p>Preliminary version 3, based on TD-33</p> </li><li> <p><em>prev3b</em></p> <p>Preliminary version 3, based on TD-33, but text encoding 
updated with the final solution for priority in 
<strong>contextProperty</strong> (which is backward compatible with v2).</p> </li><li> <p><em>prev3c</em></p> <p>Preliminary version 3, based on the final version of the 
v3-standard, but <em>excluding</em> segments!</p> </li><li> <p><em>v3</em></p> <p>Full version 3. Including segmentation. This is the default
version 3 variant (i.e. if a version 3 messages is to be 
encoded/decoded and no version3 encoding config is found, 
then v3 is assumed).</p> </li></ul><p>There are two ways to handle the different megaco encoding versions.
Either using <em>dynamic version detection</em> (only valid for
for incoming messages) or by <em>explicit version</em> setting in 
the connection info.</p><p>For incoming messages:</p><ul><li> <p>Dynamic version detection</p> <p>Set the protocol version in the megaco_receive_handle to 
<strong>dynamic</strong> (this is the default).
<br/>This works for those codecs that support partial decode of the 
version, currently <em>text</em>, and ber_bin 
(<strong>megaco_binary_encoder</strong> and <strong>megaco_ber_bin_encoder</strong>). 
<br/>This way the decoder will detect which version is used and 
then use the proper decoder. </p> </li><li> <p>Explicit version</p> <p>Explicitly set the actual protocol version in the 
megaco_receive_handle.
<br/>Start with version 1. When the initial service change has been 
performed and version 2 has been negotiated, upgrade the 
megaco_receive_handle of the transport process (control_pid) to 
version 2.
See 
<a href="./megaco_tcp#upgrade_receive_handle">megaco_tcp</a>
and 
<a href="./megaco_udp#upgrade_receive_handle">megaco_udp</a>.
<br/>Note that if <strong>udp</strong> is used, the same transport process 
could be used for several connections. This could make upgrading 
impossible.
<br/>For codecs that does not support partial decode of the version, 
currently <strong>megaco_ber_encoder</strong>, <strong>megaco_per_encoder</strong>
and <strong>megaco_per_bin_encoder</strong>, <strong>dynamic</strong> will revert to 
version 1.</p> </li></ul><p>For outgoing messages:</p><ul><li> <p>Update the connection info protocol_version.</p> </li><li> <p>Override protocol version when sending a message by adding the
item <strong>{protocol_version, integer()}</strong> to the Options.
See 
<a href="./megaco#call">call</a> or
<a href="./megaco#cast">cast</a>.
<br/>Note that this does not effect the messages that are sent
autonomously by the stack. They use the protocol_version of the
connection info.</p> </li></ul><h2>Encoder callback functions</h2><p>The encoder callback interface is defined by the <strong>megaco_encoder</strong> 
behaviour, see <a href="megaco_encoder">megaco_encoder</a>.</p></body></html>
