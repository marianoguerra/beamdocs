application.</p><h2>Compiler 7.3.2</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>An expression such as <strong>(A / B) band 16#ff</strong> would
crash the compiler.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15518 Aux Id: ERL-829 </p> </li><li> <p>There could be an incorrect warning when the
<strong>tuple_calls</strong> option was given. The generated code
would be correct. Here is an example of code that would
trigger the warning:</p> <p><strong>(list_to_atom("prefix_" ++ atom_to_list(suffix))):doit(X)</strong>.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15552 Aux Id: ERL-838 </p> </li><li> <p>Optimize (again) Dialyzer's handling of
left-associative use of <strong>andalso</strong> and <strong>orelse</strong>
in guards.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15577 Aux Id: ERL-851, PR-2141, PR-1944 </p> </li></ul><h2>Compiler 7.3.1</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>An optimization that avoided allocation of a stack
frame for some <strong>case</strong> expressions was introduced in
OTP 21. (ERL-504/OTP-14808) It turns out that in rare
circumstances, this optimization is not safe. Therefore,
this optimization has been disabled.</p> <p>A similar optimization will be included in OTP 22 in a
safe way.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15501 Aux Id: ERL-807, ERL-514, OTP-14808 </p> </li></ul><h2>Compiler 7.3</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>Fixed a rare internal consistency failure caused by a
bug in the <strong>beam_jump</strong> pass. (Thanks to Simon
Cornish for reporting this bug.)</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15400 Aux Id: ERL-759 </p> </li><li> <p>The compiler could fail with an internal consistency
check failure when compiling code that used the
<strong>is_function/2</strong> BIF.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15435 Aux Id: ERL-778 </p> </li><li> <p>When an external fun was used, warnings for unused
variables could be suppressed.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15437 Aux Id: ERL-762 </p> </li><li> <p>The compiler would crash when compiling an
<strong>after</strong> block that called <strong>erlang:raise/3</strong> like
this: <strong>erlang:raise(Class, Stacktrace, Stacktrace)</strong></p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15481</p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>When specified, the <strong>+{source,Name}</strong> option will
now override the actual file name in stack traces,
instead of only affecting the return value of
<strong>Mod:module_info()</strong>.</p> <p>The <strong>+deterministic</strong> flag will also affect stack
traces now, omitting all path information except the file
name, fixing a long-standing issue where deterministic
builds required deterministic paths.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15245 Aux Id: ERL-706 </p> </li></ul><h2>Compiler 7.2.7</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>Fixed a bug where incorrect code was generated
following a binary match guard.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15353 Aux Id: ERL-753 </p> </li></ul><h2>Compiler 7.2.6</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>In rare circumstances, the matched out tail of a
binary could be the entire original binary. (There was
partial correction to this problem in version 7.2.5 of
the compiler application.)</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15335 Aux Id: ERL-689, OTP-15219 </p> </li></ul><h2>Compiler 7.2.5</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>Fixed a bug that prevented certain variable-sized
binary comprehensions from compiling.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15186 Aux Id: ERL-665 </p> </li><li> <p>When compiling from Core Erlang, funs created in
certain expressions that were only used for their
side-effects were subtly broken.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15188 Aux Id: ERL-658 </p> </li><li> <p>There could be an internal consistency failure when a
<strong>receive</strong> was nested in a
<strong>try</strong>/<strong>catch</strong>.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15218 Aux Id: ERL-684 </p> </li><li> <p>In rare circumstances, the matched out tail of a
binary could be the entire original binary.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15219 Aux Id: ERL-689 </p> </li><li> <p>When <strong>is_map_key/2</strong> was used in a guard together
with the <strong>not/1</strong> or <strong>or/2</strong> operators, the error
behavior could be wrong when <strong>is_map_key/2</strong> was
passed a non-map as the second argument. </p> <p>In rare circumstances, compiling code that uses
<strong>is_map_key/2</strong> could cause an internal consistency
check failure.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15227 Aux Id: ERL-699 </p> </li><li> <p>The compiler could crash when compiling a function
with multiple receives in multiple clauses.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15235 Aux Id: ERL-703 </p> </li></ul><h2>Compiler 7.2.4</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>Fix a regression in OTP-15204 that removed
<strong>.beam</strong> file metadata that some external build tools
relied on.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15292</p> </li></ul><h2>Compiler 7.2.3</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>Fixed an issue where files compiled with the
<strong>+deterministic</strong> option differed if they were
compiled in a different directory but were otherwise
identical.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15204 Aux Id: ERL-679 </p> </li></ul><h2>Compiler 7.2.2</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>In rare cases involving matching of binary literal
strings, the compiler could optimize away code that
should be executed.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15156 Aux Id: ERL-655 </p> </li><li> <p>There could be an internal consistency check failure
when compiling code that called <strong>map_get(Key, Map)</strong>
and then updated the same map.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15157</p> </li><li> <p>In rare circumstances, the compiler could crash in
<strong>beam_jump</strong> when compiling a floating point
operation.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15166 Aux Id: ERL-660 </p> </li></ul><h2>Compiler 7.2.1</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>The could could crash when compiling a complicated
function that used the binary syntax.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15150 Aux Id: ERL-650 </p> </li></ul><h2>Compiler 7.2</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>Fixed an error in an optimization pass that caused
impossible tuple matching.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14855 Aux Id: ERL-549 </p> </li><li> <p>The exception thrown when a list comprehension was
given a non-list term was not always correct.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14992 Aux Id: ERL-572 </p> </li><li> <p>The compiler could produce incorrect code in rare
circumstances when the <strong>[{inline,F/A}]</strong> option was
used.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15115 Aux Id: PR-1831 </p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>Changed the default behaviour of <strong>.erlang</strong>
loading: <strong>.erlang</strong> is no longer loaded from the
current directory. <strong>c:erlangrc(PathList)</strong> can be
used to search and load an <strong>.erlang</strong> file from user
specified directories.</p> <p><strong>escript</strong>,
<strong>erlc</strong>, <strong>dialyzer</strong> and <strong>typer</strong> no longer
load an <strong>.erlang</strong> at all.</p> <p>
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14439</p> </li><li> <p>Support for "tuple calls" have been removed from the
run-time system. Tuple calls was an undocumented and
unsupported feature which allowed the module argument for
an apply operation to be a tuple: <strong>Var = dict:new(), Var:size()</strong>. This "feature" frequently caused
confusion, especially when such call failed. The
stacktrace would point out functions that don't exist in
the source code.</p> <p>For legacy code that need to use parameterized modules
or tuple calls for some other reason, there is a new
compiler option called <strong>tuple_calls</strong>. When this
option is given, the compiler will generate extra code
that emulates the old behavior for calls where the module
is a variable.</p> <p>
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14497</p> </li><li> <p>In code such as <strong>example({ok, Val}) -&gt; {ok, Val}.</strong> a tuple would be built. The compiler will now
automatically rewrite the code to
<strong>example({ok,Val}=Tuple) -&gt; Tuple.</strong> which will
reduce code size, execution time, and remove GC
pressure.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14505</p> </li><li> <p>The optimization of <strong>case</strong> expression where only
one of the case arms can execute successfully has been
improved.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14525</p> </li><li> <p>Some uses of binary matching has been slightly
improved, eliminating unnecessary register shuffling.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14594 Aux Id: ERL-444 </p> </li><li> <p>There is a new <strong>{compile_info,Info}</strong> option for
the compiler that allows BEAM-based languages such as
Elixir and LFE to add their own compiler versions.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14615 Aux Id: PR-1558 </p> </li><li> <p>Loaded BEAM code in a 64-bit system requires less
memory because of better packing of operands for
instructions.</p> <p>These memory savings were achieved by major
improvements to the <strong>beam_makeops</strong> scripts used when
building the run time system and BEAM compiler. There is
also new for documentation for <strong>beam_makeops</strong> that
describes how new BEAM instructions and loader
transformations can be implemented. The documentation is
found in here in a source directory or git repository:
erts/emulator/internal_doc/beam_makeops.md. An online
version can be found here:
https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/master/erts/emulator/internal_doc/beam_makeops.md</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14626</p> </li><li> <p>Size calculations for binary constructions has been
somewhat optimized, producing smaller code.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14654</p> </li><li> <p>When the value returned from a '<strong>catch</strong>'
expression is ignored, no stacktrace will be built if an
exception is caught. That will save time and produce less
garbage. There are also some minor optimizations of
'<strong>try</strong>/<strong>catch</strong>' both in the compiler and
run-time system.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14683</p> </li><li> <p>There is a new syntax in '<strong>try/catch</strong>' for
retrieving the stacktrace without calling
'<strong>erlang:get_stacktrace/0</strong>'. See the reference
manual for a description of the new syntax. The
'<strong>erlang:get_stacktrace/0</strong>' BIF is now
deprecated.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14692</p> </li><li> <p>The following is an internal change in the compiler,
that is not noticeable for normal use of the compiler:
The module <strong>v3_life</strong> has been removed. Its
functionality has been simplified and integrated into
<strong>v3_codegen</strong>.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14712</p> </li><li> <p>The optimization of binary matching that delays
creation of sub binaries (see the Efficiency Guide) could
be thwarted by the argument order and could be necessary
to change the argument order. The compiler has now become
smarter and can handle any argument order.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14774</p> </li><li> <p>When the compiler was faced with complex case
expressions it would unnecessarily allocate stack
elements and shuffle data between x and y registers.
Improved code generation to only allocate a stack frame
when strictly necessary.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14808 Aux Id: ERL-514 </p> </li><li> <p>There is a new option '<strong>makedep_side_effect</strong>' for
the compiler and <strong>-MMD</strong> for '<strong>erlc</strong>' that
generates dependencies and continues to compile as
normal.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14830</p> </li><li> <p>When compiling modules with huge functions, the
compiler would generate a lot of atoms for its internal,
sometimes so many that the atom table would overflow. The
compiler has been rewritten to generate far less internal
atoms to avoid filling the atom table.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14968 Aux Id: ERL-563 </p> </li><li> <p>External funs with literal values for module, name,
and arity (e.g. <strong>erlang:abs/1</strong>) are now treated as
literals. That means more efficient code that produces
less garbage on the heap.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15003</p> </li><li> <p>Two new guards BIFs operating on maps have been added:
<strong>map_get/2</strong> and <strong>is_map_key/2</strong>. They do the
same as <strong>maps:get/2</strong> and <strong>maps:is_key/2</strong>,
respectively, except that they are allowed to be used in
guards.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15037 Aux Id: PR-1784, PR-1802 </p> </li><li> <p>A call or apply of a literal external fun will be
replaced with a direct call.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15044 Aux Id: ERL-614 </p> </li><li> <p>Part of EEP-44 has been implemented.</p> <p>There is a new predefined macro called
<strong>OTP_RELEASE</strong> which is an integer indicating the OTP
release number (its value is <strong>21</strong> in this
release).</p> <p>There are new preprocessor directives
<strong>-if(Condition).</strong> and <strong>-elif(Condition).</strong>. The
<strong>if/elif</strong> supports the builtin function
<strong>defined(Symbol)</strong>.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15087 Aux Id: PR-1810 </p> </li></ul><h2>Compiler 7.1.5.2</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>Fix a regression in OTP-15204 that removed
<strong>.beam</strong> file metadata that some external build tools
relied on.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15292</p> </li></ul><h2>Compiler 7.1.5.1</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>Fixed an issue where files compiled with the
<strong>+deterministic</strong> option differed if they were
compiled in a different directory but were otherwise
identical.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15204 Aux Id: ERL-679 </p> </li></ul><h2>Compiler 7.1.5</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>The internal compiler pass (<strong>beam_validator</strong>)
that validates the generated code has been
strengthened.</p> <p>When compiling from BEAM assembly code, the
<strong>beam_type</strong> optimizer pass could make the code
unsafe. Corrected.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14863</p> </li><li> <p>Corrected optimizations of integers matched out from
binaries and used in bit operations.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14898</p> </li></ul><h2>Compiler 7.1.4</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>The '<strong>deterministic</strong>' option was not recognized
when given in a <strong>-compile()</strong> attribute in the source
code.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14773 Aux Id: ERL-498 </p> </li></ul><h2>Compiler 7.1.3</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>The compiler could issue an incorrect internal
consistency failure diagnostic for some complicated bit
syntax maches.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14640 Aux Id: ERL-490 </p> </li></ul><h2>Compiler 7.1.2</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>Fail labels on guard BIFs weren't taken into account
during an optimization pass, and a bug in the validation
pass sometimes prevented this from being noticed when a
fault occurred.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14522 Aux Id: ERIERL-48 </p> </li><li> <p>
When compiling from Core Erlang, an 'apply' with a nested
apply in the function position would be treated as an
invalid call. Corrected. (Thanks to Mikael Pettersson for
reporting this bug.)</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14526</p> </li><li> <p>Fixed checking of binary matching in the
<strong>beam_validator</strong> module to ensure that potential
compiler bugs are found at compile-time instead as
emulator crash at run-time.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14591</p> </li><li> <p>There could be false warnings for
<strong>erlang:get_stacktrace/0</strong> being used outside of a
<strong>try</strong> block when using multiple <strong>catch</strong>
clauses.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14600 Aux Id: ERL-478 </p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p> The Erlang code linter no longer checks that the
functions mentioned in <strong>nowarn_deprecated_function</strong>
options are declared in the module. </p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14378</p> </li></ul><h2>Compiler 7.1.1</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>Fail labels on guard BIFs weren't taken into account
during an optimization pass, and a bug in the validation
pass sometimes prevented this from being noticed when a
fault occurred.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14522 Aux Id: ERIERL-48 </p> </li></ul><h2>Compiler 7.1</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>For many releases, it has been legal to override a BIF
with a local function having the same name. However,
calling a local function with the same name as guard BIF
as filter in a list comprehension was not allowed.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-13690</p> </li><li> <p>compile:forms/2 would not return the module name as
documented when one of the options '<strong>from_core</strong>',
'<strong>from_asm</strong>', or '<strong>from_beam</strong>' was given. Also,
the compiler would crash if one of those options was
combined with '<strong>native</strong>'.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14408 Aux Id: ERL-417 </p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>
Optimized test for tuples with an atom as first element.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-12148</p> </li><li> <p>
Compilation of modules with huge literal binary strings
is now much faster.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-13794</p> </li><li> <p>Replaced usage of deprecated symbolic <a href="../erts/erlang#type-time_unit">erts/erlang#type-time_unit</a> representations.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-13831 Aux Id: OTP-13735 </p> </li><li> <p>The undocumented and unsupported module
<strong>sys_pre_expand</strong> has been removed. As a partial
replacement for the functionality, there is a new
function <strong>erl_internal:add_predefined_functions/1</strong>
and <strong>erl_expand_records</strong> will now add a module
prefix to calls to BIFs and imported functions.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-13856</p> </li><li> <p>The internal compiler passes now start all generated
variables with "@" to avoid any conflicts with variables
in languages such as Elixir or LFE.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-13924</p> </li><li> <p>The function <strong>fmod/2</strong> has been added to the
<strong>math</strong> module.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14000</p> </li><li> <p>Code generation for complicated guards have been
improved.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14042</p> </li><li> <p>
The compiler has new warnings for repeated identical map
keys.</p> <p>
A map expression such as,</p> <p>
<strong> #{'a' =&gt; 1, 'b' =&gt; 2, 'a' =&gt; 3}.</strong></p> <p>
will produce a warning for the repeated key 'a'.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14058</p> </li><li> <p>By default, there will now be a warning when
<strong>export_all</strong> is used. The warning can be disabled
using <strong>nowarn_export_all</strong>.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14071</p> </li><li> <p>
Optimize maps pattern matching by only examining the
common keys in each clause first instead of all keys.
This will reduce the number of lookups of each key in
maps pattern matching.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14072</p> </li><li> <p>There is a new '<strong>deterministic</strong>' option to omit
'<strong>source</strong>' and '<strong>options</strong>' tuples in the BEAM
file.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14087</p> </li><li> <p>
Analyzing modules with binary construction with huge
strings is now much faster. The compiler also compiles
such modules slightly faster.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14125 Aux Id: ERL-308 </p> </li><li> <p>Atoms may now contain arbitrary Unicode
characters.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14178</p> </li><li> <p><strong>compile:file/2</strong> now accepts the option
<strong>extra_chunks</strong> to include extra chunks in the BEAM
file.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14221</p> </li><li> <p>The format of debug information that is stored in BEAM
files (when <strong>debug_info</strong> is used) has been changed.
The purpose of the change is to better support other
BEAM-based languages such as Elixir or LFE.</p> <p>All tools included in OTP (dialyzer, debugger, cover,
and so on) will handle both the new format and the
previous format. Tools that retrieve the debug
information using <strong>beam_lib:chunk(Beam, [abstract_code])</strong> will continue to work with both the
new and old format. Tools that call
<strong>beam_lib:chunk(Beam, ["Abst"])</strong> will not work with
the new format.</p> <p>For more information, see the description of
<strong>debug_info</strong> in the documentation for
<strong>beam_lib</strong> and the description of the
<strong>{debug_info,{Backend,Data}}</strong> option in the
documentation for <strong>compile</strong>.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14369 Aux Id: PR-1367 </p> </li><li> <p>In a future release, <strong>erlang:get_stacktrace/0</strong>
will probably only work when called from within a
'<strong>try</strong>' expression (otherwise it will return
<strong>[]</strong>.</p> <p>To help prepare for that change, the compiler will now
by default warn if '<strong>get_stacktrace/0</strong>' is used in a
way that will not work in the future. Note that the
warning will not be issued if '<strong>get_stacktrace/0</strong>'
is used in a function that uses neither '<strong>catch</strong>'
nor '<strong>try</strong>' (because that could be a legal use if
the function is called from within a '<strong>try</strong>'.</p> <p>

Optimization of tuple matching has been slightly
improved.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-12951</p> </li><li> <p>Five deprecated and undocumented functions in the
module <strong>core_lib</strong> have been removed. The functions
are: <strong>get_anno/{1,2}</strong>, <strong>is_literal/1</strong>,
<strong>is_literal_list/1</strong>, and <strong>literal_value</strong>. Use
the appropriate functions in the <strong>cerl</strong> module
instead.</p> <p>

can either use the explicit module name <strong>erlang</strong> to
call the BIF, or you can remove the auto-import of that
specific BIF by using the new compiler directive
<strong>-compile({no_auto_import,[F/A]}).</strong>, which makes all
calls to the local or imported function without explicit

change makes it possible to add auto-imported BIFs
without breaking or silently changing old code in the

implications of this change is described in the
Efficiency Guide.</p> <p>Example 1: In the expression <strong>element(BitNum-1, {1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128})</strong>, the tuple used to be
constructed every time the expression was executed, which
could be detrimental to performance in two ways if the
expression was executed in a loop: the time to build the
tuple itself and the time spent in garbage collections
because the heap filled up with garbage faster.</p> <p>Example 2: Literal strings, such as <strong>"abc"</strong>, used
to be stored in the compiled code compactly as a byte
string and expanded to a list at run-time. Now all
strings will be stored expanded to lists (such as
<strong>[$a,$b,$c]</strong>) in the constant pool. That means that
the string will be faster to use at run-time, but that it
will require more space even when not used. If space is
an issue, you might want to use binary literals (that is,
<strong>&lt;&lt;"abc"&lt;&lt;</strong>) instead of string literals for
infrequently used long strings (such as error

<strong>-include_lib</strong>, the include path is temporarily
updated to include the directory the <strong>.hrl</strong> file was
found in, which will allow that <strong>.hrl</strong> file to itself
include files from the same directory using

<strong>strict_record_tests</strong>, the compiler will generate
code that verifies the record type for
<strong>R#record.field</strong> operations in guards. Code that
verifies record types in bodies has already been
generated since R10B, but in this release there will be a
<strong>{badrecord,RecordTag}</strong> instead of a
<strong>badmatch</strong> if the record verification test fails.

<strong>is_*</strong> functions.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5916</p> </li><li> <p>The compiler options <strong>ignore_try</strong> and
<strong>ignore_cond</strong>, which allowed code that used
unquoted <strong>try</strong> or <strong>cond</strong> as atoms or record
tags, has been removed. Old code that depended on the
options need to be revised to have occurrences of

single-quoted. (Note: Although <strong>cond</strong> is a reserved
keyword, there is no <strong>cond</strong> statement. It might be

generate a warning, unless one or more callbacks for the
behaviours overlap. For instance, using both the
<strong>application</strong> and <strong>supervisor</strong> behaviours
in the same module will NOT generate any warning, but

string could cause the compiler to generate dangerous
code that could cause a crash at run-time (e.g.
<strong>R#r{a="abc",b=1}</strong>). (Thanks to Mikael Karlsson.)</p> <p>Unecessary tests (such as a 'case' with two case
branches that were identical) could cause the compiler to
crash. (Thanks to Fredrik Thulin.)</p> <p>The validation pass of the compiler could generate an
error for correct code when floating point operations
were used in try/catch statements.</p> <p>In bit syntax construction, any field following a
binary field would always be marked as "aligned" (which
may or may not be correct). That would cause the hipe
native compiler to generate incorrect code if the field
was in fact unaligned. (Thanks to Per Gustafsson.)</p> <p>Some complex guard expressions (such as <strong>A#a.b==""; A#a.b==undefined</strong>) would crash the compiler. (Thanks
to Sean Hinde.)</p> <p>Compilation speed has been increased for modules with
many functions and/or atoms (such as modules generated by
the Asn1 application or other code generators).</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5632 Aux Id: seq10057 </p> </li></ul><h2>Compiler 4.3.8</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>In some circumstances, having two try/catch constructs
following each in a function body, would cause an
internal error to be generated (when in fact the
generated code was correct). (Thanks to Fredrik Thulin.)</p> <p>Incorrect calls such as <strong>M:42()</strong> would crash the
compiler. The compiler now generates a warning. (Thanks
to Ulf Wiger.)</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5553</p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>The new <strong>fun M:F/A</strong> construct creates a fun that
refers to the latest version of <strong>M:F/A</strong>. This syntax is
meant to replace tuple funs <strong>{M,F}</strong> which have many
problems.</p> <p>The new type test <strong>is_function(Fun, A)</strong> (which may be
used in guards) test whether <strong>Fun</strong> is a fun that can be
applied with <strong>A</strong> arguments. (Currently, <strong>Fun</strong> can
also be a tuple fun.)</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5584</p> </li></ul><h2>Compiler 4.3.7</h2><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>Further improvements of encrypted debug info: New option

Beam files, to help keep the source code secret. See the
documentation for <strong>compile</strong> on how to provide the key
for encrypting, and the documentation for <strong>beam_lib</strong>
on how to provide the key for decryption so that tools such
as the Debugger, Xref, or Cover can be used.</p> <p>The <strong>beam_lib:chunks/2</strong> functions now accepts an
additional chunk type <strong>compile_info</strong> to retrieve
the compilation information directly as a term. (Thanks
to Tobias Lindahl.)</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5460 Aux Id: seq9787 </p> </li></ul><h2>Compiler 4.3.5</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>Complex functions could cause the internal validator in

tuple access could be generated. The incorrect code would
either trigger an internal error in the compiler or cause
an exception at run time. (Thanks to Martin Bjorklund.)</p> <p>Corrected a bug in in bit syntax matching where
clauses could match in the wrong order. (Thanks to Ulf
Wiger.)</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5404 Aux Id: seq9767 </p> </li></ul><h2>Compiler 4.3.3</h2><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>Given bit syntax construction in certain complex
contexts involving a catch, the compiler would either
crash or terminate due to failure in an internal
consistency check. (Thanks to Fredrik Thulin.)</p> <p>Matches such as
<strong>&lt;&lt;103133:64/float&gt;&gt; = &lt;&lt;103133:64/float&gt;&gt;</strong>

such as in
<strong>L = 8, F = fun(&lt;&lt;L:L,B:L&gt;&gt;) -&gt; B end</strong> was
handled incorrectly by the compiler. The fun used to be
compiled as if it was written
'<strong>&gt;fun(&lt;&lt;8:8,B:8&gt;&gt;)</strong>, while it should be
compiled in the same way as <strong>fun(&lt;&lt;L:8,B:L&gt;&gt;)</strong>.</p> <p>A bug in the validation pass has been corrected. It
sometimes occurred when the compiler optimized by reusing
code for causing an exception when the reused code was
called from within catch or try-catch statements. Then the
validator refused to approve the code and complained about
<strong>fun(&lt;&lt;L:L,B:L&gt;&gt;) -&gt; B end</strong> was handled
incorrectly by the in the same way as
<strong>fun(&lt;&lt;L:8,B:L&gt;&gt;)</strong>.</p> <p>A bug in the unknown_catch_try_state.</p> <p>Corrected a bug in the optimizer that would cause
the compiler to crash. (Thanks to Peter-Henry Mander.)</p> <p>There are now warnings generated if a bit syntax
construction will fail at run-time because of a type
mismatch (e.g. <strong>&lt;&lt;an_atom:8&gt;&gt;</strong>).</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5342 Aux Id: OTP-5118, OTP-5270, OTP-5323 </p> </li><li> <p>Binary pattern matching such as
<strong>t(&lt;&lt;A:8&gt;&gt; = &lt;&lt;A:8&gt;)</strong> used to silently
fail at runtime (i.e. never match). The compiler now
generates an error for any such patterns.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5371</p> </li></ul><h2>Compiler 4.3.2</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>In rare cases, the code compiler code generate code
for a tuple match that could crash the emulator if passed
a term that was not a tuple.</p> <p>If a bit syntax construction failed within a catch,
previously assigned variables could get the wrong value.</p> <p>The compiler now runs a validation pass on the
generated code and aborts before writing a Beam file if
any suspect code is found. In particular, the validation
pass checks for incorrect code that may cause emulator
crashes or other strange symptoms in the emulator.</p> <p>Some corrections to the unsupported feature
