</pre>This first command enables microstate accounting for 1000 milliseconds.
See <a href="#start-0">start-0</a>,
<a href="#stop-0">stop-0</a>,
<a href="#reset-0">reset-0</a> and
<a href="#start-1">start-1</a> for more details.
The second command prints the statistics gathered during that time.
First three general statistics are printed.<dl><dt>Average real-time</dt><dd>The average time spent collecting data in the threads. This should be close to the time which data was collected. </dd><dt>System run-time</dt><dd>The total run-time of all threads in the system. This is what you get if you call <strong>msacc:stats(total_runtime,Stats).</strong> </dd><dt>Average scheduler run-time</dt><dd>The average run-time for the schedulers. This is the average amount of time the schedulers did not sleep.</dd></dl>Then one column per state is printed with a the percentage of time this
thread spent in the state out of it's own real-time. After the thread
specific time, the accumulated time for each type of thread is printed in
a similar format.Since we have the average real-time and the percentage spent in each
state we can easily calculate the time spent in each state by multiplying
<strong>Average thread real-time</strong> with <strong>Thread state %</strong>, i.e. to
get the time Scheduler 1 spent in the emulator state we do
<strong>1000513us * 0.13% = 1300us</strong>.</p><h1>Data Types</h1><span class="name">msacc_data</span><span class="name">msacc_data_thread</span><span class="name">msacc_data_counters</span><p>A map containing the different microstate accounting states and

</p><h1>Functions</h1><h2>available/0</h2><p>Check if microstate accounting is available</p><p>This function checks whether microstate accounting
is available or not.</p><h2>start/0</h2><p>Start microstate accounting.</p><p>Start microstate accounting. Returns whether it was
previously enabled or disabled.</p><h2>start/1</h2><p>Start microstate accounting for a time.</p><p>Resets all counters and then starts microstate accounting
for the given milliseconds.</p><h2>stop/0</h2><p>Stop microstate accounting.</p><p>Stop microstate accounting.
Returns whether is was previously enabled or disabled.</p><h2>reset/0</h2><p>Reset microstate accounting counters</p><p>Reset microstate accounting counters.
Returns whether is was enabled or disabled.</p><h2>print/0</h2><p>Print microstate statistics</p><p>
Prints the current microstate accounting to standard out.
Same as
<a href="#print-1">print-1</a>
</p><h2>print/1</h2><p>Print microstate statistics</p><p>Print the given microstate statistics values to stdout.
Same as
<a href="#print-1">print-1</a>
</p><h2>print/2</h2><p>Print microstate statistics</p><p>Print the given microstate statistics values to standard out.
With many states this can be quite verbose. See the top of this
reference manual for a brief description of what the fields mean.</p><p>It is possible to print more specific types of statistics by
first manipulating the <strong>DataOrStats</strong> using
<a href="#stats-2">stats-2</a>.
For instance if you want to print the percentage of run-time for each
thread you can do:</p><pre><span class="input">msacc:print(msacc:stats(runtime,msacc:stats())).</span></pre><p>If you want to only print run-time per thread type you can do:</p><pre><span class="input">msacc:print(msacc:stats(type,msacc:stats(runtime,msacc:stats()))).</span></pre><p><em>Options</em></p><dl><dt><strong>system</strong></dt><dd>Print percentage of time spent in each state out of system time as well as thread time. Default: false.</dd></dl><h2>print/3</h2><p>Print microstate statistics</p><p>Print the given microstate statistics values to the given file
or device. The other arguments behave the same way as for
<a href="#print-2">print-2</a>.</p><h2>stats/0</h2><p>Returns a runtime system independent version of the microstate
statistics data presented by
<a href="../erts/erlang#statistics_microstate_accounting">erts/erlang#statistics_microstate_accounting</a>.
All counters have been normalized to be in microsecond resolution.</p><h2>stats/2</h2><p>Returns the system time for the given microstate statistics values.
System time is the accumulated time of all threads.</p><dl><dt><strong>realtime</strong></dt><dd>Returns all time recorded for all threads.</dd><dt><strong>runtime</strong></dt><dd>Returns all time spent doing work for all threads, i.e. all time not spent in the <strong>sleep</strong> state.</dd></dl><h2>stats/2</h2><p>Returns fractions of real-time or run-time spent in the various
threads from the given microstate statistics values.</p><h2>stats/2</h2><p>Returns a list of microstate statistics values where the values
for all threads of the same type has been merged.</p><h2>to_file/1</h2><p>Dumps the current microstate statistics counters to a file that can
be parsed with <a href="../kernel/file#consult/1"> file:consult/1</a>.</p><h2>from_file/1</h2><p>Read a file dump produced by <a href="#to_file/1"> to_file(Filename)</a>.</p></body></html>
