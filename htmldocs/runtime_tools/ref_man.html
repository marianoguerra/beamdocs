tools suitable for inclusion in a production system.</p><h2>runtime_tools</h2><p>The Runtime tools Application</p><p>This chapter describes the Runtime_Tools application in OTP,
which provides low footprint tracing/debugging tools suitable
for inclusion in a production system.</p><h3>Configuration</h3><p>There are currently no configuration parameters available for
this application.
</p><h3>SEE ALSO</h3><p>application(3)</p><h2>dbg</h2><p>The Text Based Trace Facility</p><p>This module implements a text based interface to the
<a href="../erts/erlang#trace-3">erts/erlang#trace-3</a> and the
<a href="../erts/erlang#trace_pattern-2">erts/erlang#trace_pattern-2</a> BIFs.  It makes it
possible to trace functions, processes, ports and messages.

To quickly get started on tracing function calls you can use the following
code in the Erlang shell:
<pre>
1&gt; dbg:tracer(). %% Start the default trace message receiver
{ok,&lt;0.36.0&gt;}
2&gt; dbg:p(all, c). %% Setup call (c) tracing on all processes
{ok,[{matched,nonode@nohost,26}]}
3&gt; dbg:tp(lists, seq, x). %% Setup an exception return trace (x) on lists:seq
{ok,[{matched,nonode@nohost,2},{saved,x}]}
4&gt; lists:seq(1,10).
(&lt;0.34.0&gt;) call lists:seq(1,10)
(&lt;0.34.0&gt;) returned from lists:seq/2 -&gt; [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
    </pre>
For more examples of how to use <strong>dbg</strong> from the Erlang
shell, see the <a href="#simple_example">simple example</a> section.
The utilities are also suitable to use in system testing on
large systems, where other tools have too much impact on the
system performance.  Some primitive support for sequential tracing
is also included, see the <a href="#advanced">advanced topics</a> section.
</p><h2>Functions</h2><h3>fun2ms(LiteralFun) -&gt; MatchSpec</h3><p>Pseudo function that transforms fun syntax to match_spec.</p><ul><li><span class="v">LiteralFun = fun() literal</span></li><li><span class="v">MatchSpec = term()</span></li></ul><p>Pseudo function that by means of a <strong>parse_transform</strong>
translates the <em>literal</em><strong>fun()</strong> typed as parameter in
the function call to a match specification as described in
the <strong>match_spec</strong> manual of ERTS users guide.
(with literal I mean that the <strong>fun()</strong> needs to
textually be written as the parameter of the function, it
cannot be held in a variable which in turn is passed to the 
function). </p><p>The parse transform is implemented in the module
<strong>ms_transform</strong> and the source <em>must</em> include the
file <strong>ms_transform.hrl</strong> in STDLIB for this
pseudo function to work. Failing to include the hrl file in
the source will result in a runtime error, not a compile
time ditto. The include file is easiest included by adding
the line
<strong>-include_lib("stdlib/include/ms_transform.hrl").</strong> to
the source file.</p><p>The <strong>fun()</strong> is very restricted, it can take only a
single parameter (the parameter list to match), a sole variable or a
list. It needs to use the <strong>is_</strong>XXX guard tests and one
cannot use language constructs that have no representation
in a match_spec (like <strong>if</strong>, <strong>case</strong>,
<strong>receive</strong> etc). The return value from the fun will be
the return value of the resulting match_spec.</p><p>Example:</p><pre>
1&gt; <span class="input">dbg:fun2ms(fun([M,N]) when N &gt; 3 -&gt; return_trace() end).</span>
[{['$1','$2'],[{'&gt;','$2',3}],[{return_trace}]}]</pre><p>Variables from the environment can be imported, so that this
works:</p><pre>
2&gt; <span class="input">X=3.</span>
3
3&gt; <span class="input">dbg:fun2ms(fun([M,N]) when N &gt; X  -&gt; return_trace() end).</span>
[{['$1','$2'],[{'&gt;','$2',{const,3}}],[{return_trace}]}]</pre><p>The imported variables will be replaced by match_spec
<strong>const</strong> expressions, which is consistent with the
static scoping for Erlang <strong>fun()</strong>s. Local or global
function calls cannot be in the guard or body of the fun
however. Calls to builtin match_spec functions of course is
allowed:</p><pre>
4&gt; <span class="input">dbg:fun2ms(fun([M,N]) when N &gt; X, is_atomm(M)  -&gt; return_trace() end).</span>
Error: fun containing local erlang function calls ('is_atomm' called in guard)\
 cannot be translated into match_spec
{error,transform_error}
5&gt; <span class="input">dbg:fun2ms(fun([M,N]) when N &gt; X, is_atom(M)  -&gt; return_trace() end).</span>
[{['$1','$2'],[{'&gt;','$2',{const,3}},{is_atom,'$1'}],[{return_trace}]}]</pre><p>As you can see by the example, the function can be called from
the shell too. The <strong>fun()</strong> needs to be literally in the
call when used from the shell as well. Other means than the 
parse_transform are used in the shell case, but more or less
the same restrictions apply (the exception being records,
as they are not handled by the shell).</p><div class="alert alert-warning"><h4 class="alert-heading">Warning</h4><p>If the parse_transform is not applied to a module which calls this
pseudo function, the call will fail in runtime (with a 
<strong>badarg</strong>). The module <strong>dbg</strong> actually exports a
function with this name, but it should never really be called
except for when using the function in the shell. If the
<strong>parse_transform</strong> is properly applied by including
the <strong>ms_transform.hrl</strong> header file, compiled code
will never call the function, but the function call is
replaced by a literal match_spec.</p></div><p>More information is provided by the <strong>ms_transform</strong>

please turn to the
<em>User's guide</em> part of the online
documentation for the runtime system (<em>erts</em>). The
chapter <a href="./match_spec">erts/match_spec</a>
explains the general match specification "language".
The most common generic match specifications used can be
found as <strong>Built-inAlias</strong>', see
<a href="#ltp-0">ltp-0</a> below for details.
</p><p>The Module, Function and/or Arity parts of the tuple may
be specified as the atom <strong>'_'</strong> which is a "wild-card"
matching all modules/functions/arities. Note, if the
Module is specified as <strong>'_'</strong>, the Function and Arity
parts have to be specified as '_' too. The same holds for the
Functions relation to the Arity.</p><p>All nodes added with <a href="#n-1">n-1</a> or
<a href="#tracer-3">tracer-3</a> will
be affected by this call, and if Module is not <strong>'_'</strong>
the module will be loaded on all nodes.</p><p>The function returns either an error tuple or a tuple
<strong>{ok, List}</strong>. The <strong>List</strong> consists of specifications of how
many functions that matched, in the same way as the processes and ports
are presented in the return value of <a href="#p-2">p-2</a>. </p><p>There may be a tuple <strong>{saved, N}</strong> in the return value,
if the MatchSpec is other
than []. The integer <strong>N</strong> may then be used in
subsequent calls to this function and will stand as an
"alias" for the given expression. There are also a couple of
built-in aliases for common expressions, see
<a href="#ltp-0">ltp-0</a> below for details.</p><p>If an error is returned, it can be due to errors in
compilation of the match specification. Such errors are
presented as a list of tuples <strong>{error, string()}</strong> where
the string is a textual explanation of the compilation
error. An example:</p><pre>

<strong>send</strong> or <strong>'receive'</strong>. By default all executed <strong>send</strong>

explains the general match specification "language".</p><p>For <strong>send</strong>, the matching is done on the list <strong>[Receiver, Msg]</strong>.
<strong>Receiver</strong> is the process or port identity of the receiver and
<strong>Msg</strong> is the message term. The pid of the sending process can be
accessed with the guard function <strong>self/0</strong>.</p><p>For <strong>'receive'</strong>, the matching is done on the list <strong>[Node, Sender, Msg]</strong>.
<strong>Node</strong> is the node name of the sender. <strong>Sender</strong> is the
process or port identity of the sender, or the atom

be the case for remote senders). <strong>Msg</strong> is the
message term. The pid of the receiving process can be
accessed with the guard function <strong>self/0</strong>.</p><p>All nodes added with <a href="#n-1">n-1</a> or

the syntax of all match specifications and verifies that
they are correct. The error handling principle is "all or
nothing", i. e. if some of the match specifications are
wrong, none of the specifications are added to the list of
saved match specifications for the running system. </p><p>The match specifications in the file are <em>merged</em>
with the current match specifications, so that no duplicates
are generated. Use <a href="#ltp-0">ltp-0</a>
to see what numbers were
assigned to the specifications from the file.</p><p>The function will return an error, either due to I/O
problems (like a non existing or non readable file) or due
to file format problems. The errors from a bad format file
are in a more or less textual format, which will give a hint
to what's causing the problem.

node, the error reason <strong>no_local_tracer</strong> is returned. The

</p><p>If a trace port (see <a href="#trace_port-2">trace_port-2</a>) is

The <em>fun</em> takes no arguments and returns a newly opened
trace port. The return value from this function is suitable as
a second parameter to tracer/2, i.e. <strong>dbg:tracer(port, dbg:trace_port(ip, 4711))</strong>. </p><p>A trace port is an
Erlang port to a dynamically linked in driver that handles
trace messages directly, without the overhead of sending them
as messages in the Erlang virtual machine.</p><p>Two trace drivers are currently implemented, the
<strong>file</strong> and the <strong>ip</strong> trace drivers. The file driver
sends all trace messages into one or several binary files, 
from where they later can be fetched and processed with the
<a href="#trace_client-2">trace_client-2</a> function. The ip driver opens a TCP/IP
port where it listens for connections. When a client
(preferably started by calling <a href="#trace_client-2">trace_client-2</a> on
another Erlang node) connects, all trace messages are sent
over the IP network for further processing by the remote
client. </p><p>Using a trace port significantly lowers the overhead
imposed by using tracing.</p><p>The file trace driver expects a filename or a wrap files 
specification as parameter. A file is written with a high
degree of buffering, why all trace messages are <em>not</em>
guaranteed to be saved in the file in case of a system
crash. That is the price to pay for low tracing overhead.</p><p>A wrap files specification is used to limit the disk
space consumed by the trace. The trace is written to a
limited number of files each with a limited size. 
The actual filenames are <strong>Filename ++ SeqCnt ++ Suffix</strong>, where <strong>SeqCnt</strong> counts as a decimal string
from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>WrapCnt</strong> and then around again from
<strong>0</strong>. When a trace term written to 
the current file makes it longer than <strong>WrapSize</strong>,
that file is closed, if the number of files in this 
wrap trace is as many as <strong>WrapCnt</strong> the oldest file
is deleted then a new file is opened to become the current.
Thus, when a wrap trace has been stopped, there are at most
<strong>WrapCnt</strong> trace files saved with a size of at least
<strong>WrapSize</strong> (but not much bigger), except for 
the last file that might even be empty. The default values
are <strong>WrapSize = 128*1024</strong> and <strong>WrapCnt = 8</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>SeqCnt</strong> values in the filenames are all in the
range <strong>0</strong> through <strong>WrapCnt</strong> with a gap in the
circular sequence. The gap is needed to find the end of the
trace.</p><p>If the <strong>WrapSize</strong> is specified as 
<strong>{time, WrapTime}</strong>, the current file is closed when it
has been open more than <strong>WrapTime</strong> milliseconds,
regardless of it being empty or not.</p><p>The ip trace driver has a queue of <strong>QueSize</strong> messages
waiting to be delivered. If the driver cannot deliver messages
as fast as they are produced by the runtime system, a special
message is sent, which indicates how many messages that are
dropped. That message will arrive at the handler function
specified in <a href="#trace_client-3">trace_client-3</a>
as the tuple <strong>{drop, N}</strong> where <strong>N</strong> is the number of consecutive messages
dropped. In case of heavy tracing, drop's are likely to occur,
and they surely occur if no client is reading the trace
messages. The default value of <strong>QueSize</strong> is 200.</p><h3>flush_trace_port()</h3><p>Equivalent to flush_trace_port(node()).</p><p>Equivalent to <strong>flush_trace_port(node())</strong>.</p><h3>flush_trace_port(Nodename) -&gt; ok | {error, Reason}</h3><p>Flush internal data buffers in a trace driver on the given node.</p><p>Equivalent to <strong>trace_port_control(Nodename,flush)</strong>.</p><h3>trace_port_control(Operation)</h3><p>Equivalent to trace_port_control(node(),Operation).</p><p>Equivalent to <strong>trace_port_control(node(),Operation)</strong>.</p><h3>trace_port_control(Nodename,Operation) -&gt;  ok | {ok, Result} | {error, Reason}</h3><p>Perform a control operation on the active trace port driver on the given node.</p><ul><li><span class="v">Nodename = atom()</span></li></ul><p>This function is used to do a control operation on the

stored in a file by the file trace port driver.</p><p>If <strong>Type</strong> is <strong>follow_file</strong>, the client behaves as

tracing through the <strong>erlang:trace/3</strong> function. It is
sometimes desired to trace messages in a more delicate way, which
can be done with the help of the <strong>seq_trace</strong> module. 
</p><p><strong>seq_trace</strong> implements sequential tracing (known in the
AXE10 world, and sometimes called "forlopp tracing"). <strong>dbg</strong>
can interpret messages generated from <strong>seq_trace</strong> and the
same tracer function for both types of tracing can be used. The
<strong>seq_trace</strong> messages can even be sent to a trace port for
further analysis.
</p><p>As a match specification can turn on sequential tracing, the
combination of <strong>dbg</strong> and <strong>seq_trace</strong> can be quite
powerful.  This brief example shows a session where sequential
tracing is used:</p><pre>
1&gt; <span class="input">dbg:tracer().</span>
{ok,&lt;0.30.0&gt;}
2&gt; <span class="input">{ok, Tracer} = dbg:get_tracer().</span>

6&gt; <span class="input">dbg:get_tracer(), seq_trace:set_token([]).</span>
(&lt;0.25.0&gt;) call dbg:get_tracer()
SeqTrace [0]: (&lt;0.25.0&gt;) &lt;0.30.0&gt; ! {&lt;0.25.0&gt;,get_tracer} [Serial: {2,4}]
SeqTrace [0]: (&lt;0.30.0&gt;) &lt;0.25.0&gt; ! {dbg,{ok,&lt;0.31.0&gt;}} [Serial: {4,5}]
{1,0,5,&lt;0.30.0&gt;,4}</pre><p>This session sets the system_tracer to the same process as
the ordinary tracer process (i. e. &lt;0.31.0&gt;) and sets the
trace pattern for the function <strong>dbg:get_tracer</strong> to one that
has the action of setting a sequential token. When the function
is called by a traced process (all processes are traced in this
case), the process gets "contaminated" by the token and
<strong>seq_trace</strong> messages are sent both for the server request
and the response. The <strong>seq_trace:set_token([])</strong> after the
call clears the <strong>seq_trace</strong> token, why no messages are sent
when the answer propagates via the shell to the console port. 
The output would otherwise have been more noisy.</p><h3>Note of caution</h3><p>When tracing function calls on a group leader process (an IO process), there is risk 
of causing a deadlock. This will happen if a group leader process generates a trace 
message and the tracer process, by calling the trace handler function, sends an IO 
request to the same group leader. The problem can only occur if the trace handler 
prints to tty using an <strong>io</strong> function such as <a href="../stdlib/io#format-2">stdlib/io#format-2</a>.
Note that when
<strong>dbg:p(all,call)</strong> is called, IO processes are also traced.
Here's an example:</p><pre>
%% Using a default line editing shell
1&gt; <span class="input">dbg:tracer(process, {fun(Msg,_) -&gt; io:format("~p~n", [Msg]), 0 end, 0}).</span>
{ok,&lt;0.37.0&gt;}
2&gt; <span class="input">dbg:p(all, [call]).</span>
{ok,[{matched,nonode@nohost,25}]}
3&gt; <span class="input">dbg:tp(mymod,[{'_',[],[]}]).</span>
{ok,[{matched,nonode@nohost,0},{saved,1}]}
4&gt; <span class="input">mymod:</span> % TAB pressed here
%% -- Deadlock --</pre><p>Here's another example:</p><pre>
%% Using a shell without line editing (oldshell)
1&gt; <span class="input">dbg:tracer(process).</span>
{ok,&lt;0.31.0&gt;}
2&gt; <span class="input">dbg:p(all, [call]).</span>
{ok,[{matched,nonode@nohost,25}]}
3&gt; <span class="input">dbg:tp(lists,[{'_',[],[]}]).</span>
{ok,[{matched,nonode@nohost,0},{saved,1}]}
% -- Deadlock --</pre><p>The reason we get a deadlock in the first example is because when TAB is pressed 
to expand the function name, the group leader (which handles character input) calls
<strong>mymod:module_info()</strong>. This generates a trace message which, in turn, causes the 
tracer process to send an IO request to the group leader (by calling <strong>io:format/2</strong>).
We end up in a deadlock.</p><p>In the second example we use the default trace handler function. This handler
prints to tty by sending IO requests to the <strong>user</strong> process. When Erlang is
started in oldshell mode, the shell process will have <strong>user</strong> as its
group leader and so will the tracer process in this example. Since <strong>user</strong> calls 
functions in <strong>lists</strong> we end up in a deadlock as soon as the first IO request is sent.</p><p>Here are a few suggestions for how to avoid deadlock:</p><ul><li>Don't trace the group leader of the tracer process. If tracing has been switched on for all processes, call <strong>dbg:p(TracerGLPid,clear)</strong> to stop tracing the group leader (<strong>TracerGLPid</strong>). <strong>process_info(TracerPid,group_leader)</strong> tells you  which process this is (<strong>TracerPid</strong> is returned from <strong>dbg:get_tracer/0</strong>).</li><li>Don't trace the <strong>user</strong> process if using the default trace handler function.</li><li>In your own trace handler function, call <strong>erlang:display/1</strong> instead of an <strong>io</strong> function or, if <strong>user</strong> is not used as group leader, print to  <strong>user</strong> instead of the default group leader. Example: <strong>io:format(user,Str,Args)</strong>.</li></ul><h2>dyntrace</h2><p>Interface to dynamic tracing</p><p>This module implements interfaces to dynamic tracing, should such be compiled into the virtual machine. For a standard and/or commercial build, no dynamic tracing is available, in which case none of the functions in this module is usable or give any effect.Should dynamic tracing be enabled in the current build, either by configuring with <strong>./configure --with-dynamic-trace=dtrace</strong> or with  <strong>./configure --with-dynamic-trace=systemtap</strong>, the module can be used for two things:<ul><li>Trigger the user-probe <strong>user_trace_i4s4</strong> in the NIF library <strong>dyntrace.so</strong> by calling <strong>dyntrace:p/{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}</strong>.</li><li>Set a user specified tag that will be present in the trace messages of both the <strong>efile_drv</strong> and the user-probe mentioned above.</li></ul>Both building with dynamic trace probes and using them is experimental and unsupported by Erlang/OTP. It is included as an option for the developer to trace and debug performance issues in their systems.The original implementation is mostly done by Scott Lystiger Fritchie as an Open Source Contribution and it should be viewed as such even though the source for dynamic tracing as well as this module is included in the main distribution. However, the ability to use dynamic tracing of the virtual machine is a very valuable contribution which OTP has every intention to maintain as a tool for the developer.How to write <strong>d</strong> programs or <strong>systemtap</strong> scripts can be learned from books and from a lot of pages on the Internet. This manual page does not include any documentation about using the dynamic trace tools of respective platform. The <strong>examples</strong> directory of the <strong>runtime_tools</strong> application however contains comprehensive examples of both <strong>d</strong> and <strong>systemtap</strong> programs that will help you get started. Another source of information is the <a href="DTRACE">dtrace</a> and <a href="SYSTEMTAP">systemtap</a> chapters in the Runtime Tools Users' Guide.</p><h2>Functions</h2><h3>available() -&gt; boolean()</h3><p>Check if dynamic tracing is available</p><p>This function uses the NIF library to determine if dynamic

process or, if no user tag is present, the last user tag sent
to the process together with a message (in the same way as
<a href="./seq_trace">sequential trace tokens</a> are spread to other processes together with
messages. For an explanation of how user tags can be spread
together with messages, see <a href="#spread_tag/1">spread_tag/1</a>. If no tag is

<strong>undefined</strong></p><h3>put_tag(Item) -&gt; binary() | undefined</h3><p>Set the user tag of the current process.</p><ul><li><span class="v">Item = iodata()</span></li></ul><p>This function sets the user tag of the current process. The user tag is a binary(), but can be specified as any iodata(), which is automatically converted to a binary by this function.</p><p>The user tag is provided to the user probes triggered by calls top <strong>dyntrace:p/{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}</strong> as well as probes in the efile_driver. In the future, user tags might be added to more probes.</p><p>The old user tag (if any) is returned, or <strong>undefined</strong> if no user tag was present or dynamic tracing is not enabled.</p><h3>spread_tag(boolean()) -&gt; TagData</h3><p>Start or stop spreading dynamic trace user tags with the next message.</p><ul><li><span class="v">TagData = opaque data that can be used as parameter to </span></li></ul><p>This function controls if user tags are to be spread to other processes with the next message. Spreading of user tags work like spreading of sequential trace tokens, so that a received user tag will be active in the process until the next message arrives (if that message does not also contain the user tag.</p><p>This functionality is used when a client process communicates with a file i/o-server to spread the user tag to the I/O-server and then down to the efile_drv driver. By using <strong>spread_tag/1</strong> and <strong>restore_tag/1</strong>, one can enable or disable spreading of user tags to other processes and then restore the previous state of the user tag. The TagData returned from this call contains all previous information so the state (including any previously spread user tags) will be completely restored by a later call to <strong>restore_tag/1</strong>.</p><p>The <a href="./file">file</a> module already spread's tags, so there is noo need to manually call these function to get user tags spread to the efile driver through that module.</p><p>The most use of this function would be if one for example uses the <a href="./io">io</a> module to communicate with an I/O-server for a regular file, like in the following example:</p><pre>
f() -&gt;
   {ok, F} = file:open("test.tst",[write]),
   Saved = dyntrace:spread_tag(true),
   io:format(F,"Hello world!",[]),
   dyntrace:restore_tag(Saved),
   file:close(F).
</pre><p>In this example, any user tag set in the calling process will be spread to the I/O-server when the io:format call is done.</p><h3>restore_tag(TagData) -&gt; true</h3><p>Restore to a previous state of user tag spreading.</p><ul><li><span class="v">TagData = opaque data returned by </span></li></ul><p>Restores the previous state of user tags and their spreading as it was before a call to <a href="#spread_tag/1">spread_tag/1</a>. Note that the restoring is not limited to the same process, one can utilize this to turn off spreding in one process and restore it in a newly created, the one that actually is going to send messages:</p><pre>
f() -&gt;
    TagData=dyntrace:spread_tag(false),
    spawn(fun() -&gt;
             dyntrace:restore_tag(TagData),
             do_something()
          end),
    do_something_else(),
    dyntrace:restore_tag(TagData).
</pre><p>Correctly handling user tags and their spreading might take some effort, as Erlang programs tend to send and receive messages so that sometimes the user tag gets lost due to various things, like double receives or communication with a port (ports do not handle user tags, in the same way as they do not handle regular sequential trace tokens).</p><h2>erts_alloc_config</h2><p>Configuration tool for erts_alloc</p><p><a href="./erts_alloc">erts_alloc(3)</a> is an
Erlang Run-Time System internal memory allocator library.
<strong>erts_alloc_config</strong> is intended to be used to aid creation
of an <a href="./erts_alloc">erts_alloc(3)</a>
configuration that is suitable for a limited number of runtime
scenarios. The configuration that <strong>erts_alloc_config</strong>
produce is intended as a suggestion, and may need to be
adjusted manually.The configuration is created based on information about a number
of runtime scenarios. It is obviously impossible to foresee every
runtime scenario that can occur. The important scenarios are
those that cause maximum or minimum load on specific memory
allocators. Load in this context is total size of memory blocks
allocated.The current implementation of <strong>erts_alloc_config</strong> concentrate
on configuration of multi-block carriers. Information gathered
when a runtime scenario is saved is mainly current and maximum use
of multi-block carriers. If a parameter that change the use of
multi-block carriers is changed, a previously generated
configuration is invalid and <strong>erts_alloc_config</strong> needs
to be run again. It is mainly the single block carrier threshold
that effects the use of multi-block carriers, but other
single-block carrier parameters might as well. If another value of
a single block carrier parameter than the default is desired, use
the desired value when running <strong>erts_alloc_config</strong>.A configuration is created in the following way:<ul><li> <p>Pass the <a href="../erts/erts_alloc#Mea">+Mea config</a>
command-line flag to the Erlang runtime system you are going
to use for creation of the allocator configuration. It will
disable features that prevent <strong>erts_alloc_config</strong> from
doing its job. Note, you should <em>not</em> use this flag
when using the created configuration. Also note that it is
important that you use the same
<a href="../erts/erl#+S">amount of schedulers</a>
when creating the configuration as you are going the use on
the system using the configuration.</p> </li><li> <p>Run your applications with different scenarios (the more
the better) and save information about each scenario by calling
<a href="#save_scenario/0">save_scenario/0</a>.
It may be hard to know when the applications are at an (for
<strong>erts_alloc_config</strong>) important runtime scenario. A good
approach may therefore be to call
<a href="#save_scenario/0">save_scenario/0</a>
repeatedly, e.g. once every tenth second. Note that it is
important that your applications reach the runtime scenarios
that are important for <strong>erts_alloc_config</strong> when you are
saving scenarios; otherwise, the configuration may perform
bad.</p> </li><li> <p>When you have covered all scenarios, call
<a href="#make_config/1">make_config/1</a>
in order to create a configuration. The configuration is
written to a file that you have chosen. This configuration
file can later be read by an Erlang runtime-system at
startup. Pass the command line argument 
<a href="../erts/erl#args_file">-args_file FileName</a>
to the <a href="./erl">erl(1)</a> command.</p> </li><li> <p>The configuration produced by <strong>erts_alloc_config</strong> may
need to be manually adjusted as already stated. Do not modify the
file produced by <strong>erts_alloc_config</strong>; instead, put your
modifications in another file and load this file after the
file produced by <strong>erts_alloc_config</strong>. That is, put the
<a href="../erts/erl#args_file">-args_file FileName</a>
argument that reads your modification file later on the
command-line than the 
<a href="../erts/erl#args_file">-args_file FileName</a>
argument that reads the configuration file produced by
<strong>erts_alloc_config</strong>. If a memory allocation parameter
appear multiple times, the last version of will be used, i.e.,
you can override parameters in the configuration file produced
by <strong>erts_alloc_config</strong>. Doing it this way simplifies
things when you want to rerun <strong>erts_alloc_config</strong>.</p> </li></ul><strong>erts_alloc_config</strong> saves information about runtime scenarios
and performs computations in a server that is automatically
started. The server register itself under the name
<strong>'__erts_alloc_config__'</strong>.</p><h2>Functions</h2><h3>save_scenario() -&gt; ok | {error, Error}</h3><p>Saves information about current runtime scenario</p><ul><li><span class="v">Error = term()</span></li></ul><p><strong>save_scenario/0</strong> saves information about the current

is called.</p><p>The first time <strong>save_scenario/0</strong> is called a server
