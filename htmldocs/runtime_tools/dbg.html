<a href="../erts/erlang#trace-3">erts/erlang#trace-3</a> and the
<a href="../erts/erlang#trace_pattern-2">erts/erlang#trace_pattern-2</a> BIFs.  It makes it
possible to trace functions, processes, ports and messages.

To quickly get started on tracing function calls you can use the following
code in the Erlang shell:
<pre>
1&gt; dbg:tracer(). %% Start the default trace message receiver
{ok,&lt;0.36.0&gt;}
2&gt; dbg:p(all, c). %% Setup call (c) tracing on all processes
{ok,[{matched,nonode@nohost,26}]}
3&gt; dbg:tp(lists, seq, x). %% Setup an exception return trace (x) on lists:seq
{ok,[{matched,nonode@nohost,2},{saved,x}]}
4&gt; lists:seq(1,10).
(&lt;0.34.0&gt;) call lists:seq(1,10)
(&lt;0.34.0&gt;) returned from lists:seq/2 -&gt; [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
    </pre>
For more examples of how to use <strong>dbg</strong> from the Erlang
shell, see the <a href="#simple_example">simple example</a> section.
The utilities are also suitable to use in system testing on
large systems, where other tools have too much impact on the
system performance.  Some primitive support for sequential tracing
is also included, see the <a href="#advanced">advanced topics</a> section.
</p><h1>Functions</h1><h2>fun2ms(LiteralFun) -&gt; MatchSpec</h2><p>Pseudo function that transforms fun syntax to match_spec.</p><ul><li><span class="v">LiteralFun = fun() literal</span></li><li><span class="v">MatchSpec = term()</span></li></ul><p>Pseudo function that by means of a <strong>parse_transform</strong>
translates the <em>literal</em><strong>fun()</strong> typed as parameter in
the function call to a match specification as described in
the <strong>match_spec</strong> manual of ERTS users guide.
(with literal I mean that the <strong>fun()</strong> needs to
textually be written as the parameter of the function, it
cannot be held in a variable which in turn is passed to the 
function). </p><p>The parse transform is implemented in the module
<strong>ms_transform</strong> and the source <em>must</em> include the
file <strong>ms_transform.hrl</strong> in STDLIB for this
pseudo function to work. Failing to include the hrl file in
the source will result in a runtime error, not a compile
time ditto. The include file is easiest included by adding
the line
<strong>-include_lib("stdlib/include/ms_transform.hrl").</strong> to
the source file.</p><p>The <strong>fun()</strong> is very restricted, it can take only a
single parameter (the parameter list to match), a sole variable or a
list. It needs to use the <strong>is_</strong>XXX guard tests and one
cannot use language constructs that have no representation
in a match_spec (like <strong>if</strong>, <strong>case</strong>,
<strong>receive</strong> etc). The return value from the fun will be
the return value of the resulting match_spec.</p><p>Example:</p><pre>
1&gt; <span class="input">dbg:fun2ms(fun([M,N]) when N &gt; 3 -&gt; return_trace() end).</span>
[{['$1','$2'],[{'&gt;','$2',3}],[{return_trace}]}]</pre><p>Variables from the environment can be imported, so that this
works:</p><pre>
2&gt; <span class="input">X=3.</span>
3
3&gt; <span class="input">dbg:fun2ms(fun([M,N]) when N &gt; X  -&gt; return_trace() end).</span>
[{['$1','$2'],[{'&gt;','$2',{const,3}}],[{return_trace}]}]</pre><p>The imported variables will be replaced by match_spec
<strong>const</strong> expressions, which is consistent with the
static scoping for Erlang <strong>fun()</strong>s. Local or global
function calls cannot be in the guard or body of the fun
however. Calls to builtin match_spec functions of course is
allowed:</p><pre>
4&gt; <span class="input">dbg:fun2ms(fun([M,N]) when N &gt; X, is_atomm(M)  -&gt; return_trace() end).</span>
Error: fun containing local erlang function calls ('is_atomm' called in guard)\
 cannot be translated into match_spec
{error,transform_error}
5&gt; <span class="input">dbg:fun2ms(fun([M,N]) when N &gt; X, is_atom(M)  -&gt; return_trace() end).</span>
[{['$1','$2'],[{'&gt;','$2',{const,3}},{is_atom,'$1'}],[{return_trace}]}]</pre><p>As you can see by the example, the function can be called from
the shell too. The <strong>fun()</strong> needs to be literally in the
call when used from the shell as well. Other means than the 
parse_transform are used in the shell case, but more or less
the same restrictions apply (the exception being records,
as they are not handled by the shell).</p><div class="alert alert-warning"><h4 class="alert-heading">Warning</h4><p>If the parse_transform is not applied to a module which calls this
pseudo function, the call will fail in runtime (with a 
<strong>badarg</strong>). The module <strong>dbg</strong> actually exports a
function with this name, but it should never really be called
except for when using the function in the shell. If the
<strong>parse_transform</strong> is properly applied by including
the <strong>ms_transform.hrl</strong> header file, compiled code
will never call the function, but the function call is
replaced by a literal match_spec.</p></div><p>More information is provided by the <strong>ms_transform</strong>

explains the general match specification "language".
The most common generic match specifications used can be
found as <strong>Built-inAlias</strong>', see
<a href="#ltp-0">ltp-0</a> below for details.
</p><p>The Module, Function and/or Arity parts of the tuple may
be specified as the atom <strong>'_'</strong> which is a "wild-card"
matching all modules/functions/arities. Note, if the

<strong>{ok, List}</strong>. The <strong>List</strong> consists of specifications of how
many functions that matched, in the same way as the processes and ports
are presented in the return value of <a href="#p-2">p-2</a>. </p><p>There may be a tuple <strong>{saved, N}</strong> in the return value,
if the MatchSpec is other
than []. The integer <strong>N</strong> may then be used in

"alias" for the given expression. There are also a couple of
built-in aliases for common expressions, see
<a href="#ltp-0">ltp-0</a> below for details.</p><p>If an error is returned, it can be due to errors in
compilation of the match specification. Such errors are
presented as a list of tuples <strong>{error, string()}</strong> where

Erlang port to a dynamically linked in driver that handles
trace messages directly, without the overhead of sending them
as messages in the Erlang virtual machine.</p><p>Two trace drivers are currently implemented, the
<strong>file</strong> and the <strong>ip</strong> trace drivers. The file driver
sends all trace messages into one or several binary files, 
from where they later can be fetched and processed with the
<a href="#trace_client-2">trace_client-2</a> function. The ip driver opens a TCP/IP
port where it listens for connections. When a client
(preferably started by calling <a href="#trace_client-2">trace_client-2</a> on
another Erlang node) connects, all trace messages are sent
over the IP network for further processing by the remote
client. </p><p>Using a trace port significantly lowers the overhead
imposed by using tracing.</p><p>The file trace driver expects a filename or a wrap files 
specification as parameter. A file is written with a high
degree of buffering, why all trace messages are <em>not</em>
guaranteed to be saved in the file in case of a system
crash. That is the price to pay for low tracing overhead.</p><p>A wrap files specification is used to limit the disk
space consumed by the trace. The trace is written to a
limited number of files each with a limited size. 
The actual filenames are <strong>Filename ++ SeqCnt ++ Suffix</strong>, where <strong>SeqCnt</strong> counts as a decimal string
from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>WrapCnt</strong> and then around again from
<strong>0</strong>. When a trace term written to 
the current file makes it longer than <strong>WrapSize</strong>,
that file is closed, if the number of files in this 
wrap trace is as many as <strong>WrapCnt</strong> the oldest file
is deleted then a new file is opened to become the current.
Thus, when a wrap trace has been stopped, there are at most
<strong>WrapCnt</strong> trace files saved with a size of at least
<strong>WrapSize</strong> (but not much bigger), except for 
the last file that might even be empty. The default values
are <strong>WrapSize = 128*1024</strong> and <strong>WrapCnt = 8</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>SeqCnt</strong> values in the filenames are all in the
range <strong>0</strong> through <strong>WrapCnt</strong> with a gap in the
circular sequence. The gap is needed to find the end of the
trace.</p><p>If the <strong>WrapSize</strong> is specified as 
<strong>{time, WrapTime}</strong>, the current file is closed when it
has been open more than <strong>WrapTime</strong> milliseconds,
regardless of it being empty or not.</p><p>The ip trace driver has a queue of <strong>QueSize</strong> messages
waiting to be delivered. If the driver cannot deliver messages
as fast as they are produced by the runtime system, a special
message is sent, which indicates how many messages that are
dropped. That message will arrive at the handler function
specified in <a href="#trace_client-3">trace_client-3</a>
as the tuple <strong>{drop, N}</strong> where <strong>N</strong> is the number of consecutive messages
dropped. In case of heavy tracing, drop's are likely to occur,
and they surely occur if no client is reading the trace
messages. The default value of <strong>QueSize</strong> is 200.</p><h2>flush_trace_port()</h2><p>Equivalent to flush_trace_port(node()).</p><p>Equivalent to <strong>flush_trace_port(node())</strong>.</p><h2>flush_trace_port(Nodename) -&gt; ok | {error, Reason}</h2><p>Flush internal data buffers in a trace driver on the given node.</p><p>Equivalent to <strong>trace_port_control(Nodename,flush)</strong>.</p><h2>trace_port_control(Operation)</h2><p>Equivalent to trace_port_control(node(),Operation).</p><p>Equivalent to <strong>trace_port_control(node(),Operation)</strong>.</p><h2>trace_port_control(Nodename,Operation) -&gt;  ok | {ok, Result} | {error, Reason}</h2><p>Perform a control operation on the active trace port driver on the given node.</p><ul><li><span class="v">Nodename = atom()</span></li></ul><p>This function is used to do a control operation on the

tracing through the <strong>erlang:trace/3</strong> function. It is
sometimes desired to trace messages in a more delicate way, which
can be done with the help of the <strong>seq_trace</strong> module. 
</p><p><strong>seq_trace</strong> implements sequential tracing (known in the
AXE10 world, and sometimes called "forlopp tracing"). <strong>dbg</strong>
can interpret messages generated from <strong>seq_trace</strong> and the
same tracer function for both types of tracing can be used. The
<strong>seq_trace</strong> messages can even be sent to a trace port for
further analysis.
</p><p>As a match specification can turn on sequential tracing, the
combination of <strong>dbg</strong> and <strong>seq_trace</strong> can be quite
powerful.  This brief example shows a session where sequential
tracing is used:</p><pre>
1&gt; <span class="input">dbg:tracer().</span>
{ok,&lt;0.30.0&gt;}
2&gt; <span class="input">{ok, Tracer} = dbg:get_tracer().</span>

SeqTrace [0]: (&lt;0.30.0&gt;) &lt;0.25.0&gt; ! {dbg,{ok,&lt;0.31.0&gt;}} [Serial: {4,5}]
{1,0,5,&lt;0.30.0&gt;,4}</pre><p>This session sets the system_tracer to the same process as
the ordinary tracer process (i. e. &lt;0.31.0&gt;) and sets the
trace pattern for the function <strong>dbg:get_tracer</strong> to one that
has the action of setting a sequential token. When the function
is called by a traced process (all processes are traced in this
case), the process gets "contaminated" by the token and
<strong>seq_trace</strong> messages are sent both for the server request
and the response. The <strong>seq_trace:set_token([])</strong> after the
call clears the <strong>seq_trace</strong> token, why no messages are sent
when the answer propagates via the shell to the console port. 
The output would otherwise have been more noisy.</p><h2>Note of caution</h2><p>When tracing function calls on a group leader process (an IO process), there is risk 
of causing a deadlock. This will happen if a group leader process generates a trace 
message and the tracer process, by calling the trace handler function, sends an IO 
request to the same group leader. The problem can only occur if the trace handler 
prints to tty using an <strong>io</strong> function such as <a href="../stdlib/io#format-2">stdlib/io#format-2</a>.
Note that when
<strong>dbg:p(all,call)</strong> is called, IO processes are also traced.
Here's an example:</p><pre>
%% Using a default line editing shell
1&gt; <span class="input">dbg:tracer(process, {fun(Msg,_) -&gt; io:format("~p~n", [Msg]), 0 end, 0}).</span>

3&gt; <span class="input">dbg:tp(mymod,[{'_',[],[]}]).</span>
{ok,[{matched,nonode@nohost,0},{saved,1}]}
4&gt; <span class="input">mymod:</span> % TAB pressed here
%% -- Deadlock --</pre><p>Here's another example:</p><pre>
%% Using a shell without line editing (oldshell)
1&gt; <span class="input">dbg:tracer(process).</span>
{ok,&lt;0.31.0&gt;}
2&gt; <span class="input">dbg:p(all, [call]).</span>
{ok,[{matched,nonode@nohost,25}]}
3&gt; <span class="input">dbg:tp(lists,[{'_',[],[]}]).</span>
{ok,[{matched,nonode@nohost,0},{saved,1}]}
% -- Deadlock --</pre><p>The reason we get a deadlock in the first example is because when TAB is pressed 
to expand the function name, the group leader (which handles character input) calls
<strong>mymod:module_info()</strong>. This generates a trace message which, in turn, causes the 
tracer process to send an IO request to the group leader (by calling <strong>io:format/2</strong>).
We end up in a deadlock.</p><p>In the second example we use the default trace handler function. This handler
prints to tty by sending IO requests to the <strong>user</strong> process. When Erlang is
started in oldshell mode, the shell process will have <strong>user</strong> as its
group leader and so will the tracer process in this example. Since <strong>user</strong> calls 
functions in <strong>lists</strong> we end up in a deadlock as soon as the first IO request is sent.</p><p>Here are a few suggestions for how to avoid deadlock:</p><ul><li>Don't trace the group leader of the tracer process. If tracing has been switched on for all processes, call <strong>dbg:p(TracerGLPid,clear)</strong> to stop tracing the group leader (<strong>TracerGLPid</strong>). <strong>process_info(TracerPid,group_leader)</strong> tells you  which process this is (<strong>TracerPid</strong> is returned from <strong>dbg:get_tracer/0</strong>).</li><li>Don't trace the <strong>user</strong> process if using the default trace handler function.</li><li>In your own trace handler function, call <strong>erlang:display/1</strong> instead of an <strong>io</strong> function or, if <strong>user</strong> is not used as group leader, print to  <strong>user</strong> instead of the default group leader. Example: <strong>io:format(user,Str,Args)</strong>.</li></ul></body></html>
