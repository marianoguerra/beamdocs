are loaded, or will be loaded when used. You might have
application versions that satisfies all dependencies
installed in the system, but if those are not loaded this
check will fail. The system will of course also fail when
used like this. This may happen when you have multiple 
<a href="./versions">branched versions</a> of the same application installed in the
system, but you do not use a
<a href="../doc/system_principles/system_principles#BOOTSCRIPT">boot script</a> identifing the correct application version.</p> </dd></dl><p>Currently the sanity check is limited to verifying
runtime dependencies found in the <strong>.app</strong> files of
all applications. More checks will be introduced in the
future. This implies that the return type <em>will</em>
change in the future.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>An <strong>ok</strong> return value only means that
