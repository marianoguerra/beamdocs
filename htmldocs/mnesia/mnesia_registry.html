application, but is currently part of the Mnesia
application.This module is mainly intended for internal use within OTP,
but it has two functions that are exported for public use.On C-nodes, <strong>erl_interface</strong> has support for registry
tables. These tables reside in RAM on the C-node, but can also
be dumped into Mnesia tables. By default, the dumping
of registry tables through <strong>erl_interface</strong> causes a
corresponding Mnesia table to be created with
<strong>mnesia_registry:create_table/1</strong>, if necessary.Tables that are created with these functions can be
administered as all other Mnesia tables. They can be
included in backups, replicas can be added, and so on.
The tables are normal Mnesia tables owned by the user
of the corresponding <strong>erl_interface</strong> registries.</p><h1>Functions</h1><h2>create_table(Tab) -&gt; ok | exit(Reason)</h2><p>Creates a registry table in Mnesia.</p><p>A wrapper function for <strong>mnesia:create_table/2</strong>,
which creates a table (if there is no existing table)
with an appropriate set of <strong>attributes</strong>. The table
only resides on the local node and its storage type is
the same as the <strong>schema</strong> table on the local node,
that is, <strong>{ram_copies,[node()]}</strong> or
<strong>{disc_copies,[node()]}</strong>.</p><p>This function is used by <strong>erl_interface</strong> to
create the Mnesia table if it does not already
exist.</p><h2>create_table(Tab, TabDef) -&gt; ok | exit(Reason)</h2><p>Creates a customized registry table in Mnesia.</p><p>A wrapper function for <strong>mnesia:create_table/2</strong>,
which creates a table (if there is no existing table)
with an appropriate set of <strong>attributes</strong>. The
attributes and <strong>TabDef</strong> are forwarded to
<strong>mnesia:create_table/2</strong>. For example, if the table
is to reside as <strong>disc_only_copies</strong> on all nodes,
a call looks as follows:</p><pre><code class="">
          TabDef = [{{disc_only_copies, node()|nodes()]}],
          mnesia_registry:create_table(my_reg, TabDef)</code></pre><h2>See Also</h2><p><a href="./index">erl_interface(3)</a>,
