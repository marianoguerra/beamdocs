reconfigured remotely. It is sometimes an advantage to perform
this remote control with an open protocol such as the Simple
Network Management Protocol (SNMP). The alternatives to this would
be the following:</p><ul><li>Not being able to control the application remotely </li><li>Using a proprietary control protocol </li><li>Using a bridge that maps control messages in a proprietary protocol to a standardized management protocol and conversely </li></ul><p>All these approaches have different advantages and
disadvantages. Mnesia applications can easily be opened to
the SNMP protocol. A direct 1-to-1 mapping can be established
between Mnesia tables and SNMP tables. This means
that a Mnesia table can be configured to be <em>both</em>
a Mnesia table and an SNMP table. A number of functions to
control this behavior are described in the Reference Manual.</p></body></html>
