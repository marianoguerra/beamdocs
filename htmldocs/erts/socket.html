It is used to create, delete and manipulate sockets,
send and receive data.The idea is that it shall be as "close as possible" to the OS
level socket interface. The only significant addition is that some of
the functions,
e.g. <a href="#recv/3">recv/3</a>, 
has a timeout argument. </p><h1>Data Types</h1><span class="name">domain</span><span class="name">type</span><span class="name">protocol</span><span class="name">socket()</span><p>As returned by

(<strong>stream</strong> or <strong>seqpacket</strong>). It extracs the first pending
connection request for the listen socket and returns the (newly)
connected socket.</p><h2>bind/2</h2><p>Bind a name to a socket.</p><p>Bind a name to a socket.</p><p>When a socket is created
(with <a href="#open/2">open/2</a>),
it has no address assigned to it. <strong>bind</strong> assigns the
address specified by the <strong>Addr</strong> argument.</p><p>The rules used for name binding vary between domains.</p><h2>close/1</h2><p>Close a socket.</p><p>Closes the socket.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>Note that for e.g. <strong>protocol</strong> = <strong>tcp</strong>, most implementations
doing a close does not guarantee that any data sent is delivered to
the recipient before the close is detected at the remote side. </p><p>One way to handle this is to use the
<a href="#shutdown/2">shutdown/2</a>
function
(<strong>socket:shutdown(Socket, write)</strong>) to signal that no more data is
to be sent and then wait for the read side of the socket to be closed.</p></div><h2>connect/2</h2><h2>connect/3</h2><p>Initiate a connection on a socket.</p><p>This function connects the socket to the address
specied by the <strong>SockAddr</strong> argument.</p><h2>getopt/3</h2><h2>getopt/3</h2><h2>getopt/3</h2><h2>getopt/3</h2><h2>getopt/3</h2><h2>getopt/3</h2><h2>getopt/3</h2><p>Get an option on a socket.</p><p>Get an option on a socket.</p><p>What properties are valid depend  both on <strong>Level</strong> and
on what kind of socket it is (<strong>domain</strong>, <strong>type</strong> and
<strong>protocol</strong>).</p><p>See the
<a href="./socket_usage#socket_options">socket options</a>
chapter of the users guide for more info. </p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>Not all options are valid on all platforms. That is,

on what kind of socket it is (<strong>domain</strong>, <strong>type</strong> and
<strong>protocol</strong>).</p><p>When specifying <strong>Level</strong> as an integer, and therefor
using "native mode", it is *currently* up to the caller to
know how to interpret the result.</p><p>See the

be used if no protocol is specified: </p><ul><li><p><strong>stream</strong>: <strong>tcp</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>dgram</strong>: <strong>udp</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>seqpacket</strong>: <strong>sctp</strong></p></li></ul><p>The <strong>Extra</strong> argument is intended for "obscure" options.
Currently the only supported option is <strong>netns</strong>, which
is only supported on the linux platform.</p><h2>peername/1</h2><p>Get name of connected socket peer.</p><p>Returns the address of the peer connected to the socket.</p><h2>recv/1</h2><h2>recv/2</h2><h2>recv/3</h2><h2>recv/3</h2><h2>recv/4</h2><p>Receive a message from a socket.</p><p>Receive a message from a socket.</p><p>There is a special case for the argument <strong>Length</strong>.
If it is set to zero (0), it means "give me everything you 
currently have".</p><h2>recvfrom/1</h2><h2>recvfrom/2</h2><h2>recvfrom/3</h2><h2>recvfrom/3</h2><h2>recvfrom/3</h2><h2>recvfrom/4</h2><p>Receive a message from a socket.</p><p>Receive a message from a socket.</p><p>This function reads "messages", which means that regardless of
how much we want to read, it returns when we get a message.</p><p>The <strong>BufSz</strong> argument basically defines the size of the
receive buffer. By setting the value to zero (0), the configured
size (setopt with <strong>Level</strong> = <strong>otp</strong> and <strong>Key</strong> = <strong>rcvbuf</strong>)
is used.</p><p>It may be impossible to know what (buffer) size is appropriate
"in advance", and in those cases it may be convenient to use the
(recv) 'peek' flag. When this flag is provided, the message is *not*
"consumed" from the underlying buffers, so another recvfrom call
is needed, possibly with a then adjusted buffer size.</p><h2>recvmsg/1</h2><h2>recvmsg/2</h2><h2>recvmsg/2</h2><h2>recvmsg/3</h2><h2>recvmsg/3</h2><h2>recvmsg/5</h2><p>Receive a message from a socket.</p><p>Receive a message from a socket.</p><p>This function reads "messages", which means that regardless of
how much we want to read, it returns when we get a message.</p><p>The message will be delivered in the form of a <strong>msghdr()</strong>,
which may contain the source address (if socket not connected),
a list of <strong>cmsghdr_recv()</strong> (depends on what socket options have
been set and what the protocol and platform supports) and
also a set of flags, providing further info about the read. </p><p>The <strong>BufSz</strong> argument basically defines the size of the

(socket <em>not</em> connected) is provided in the <strong>MsgHdr</strong>,
which also contains the message to send,
The <strong>MsgHdr</strong> may also contain an list of optional <strong>cmsghdr_send()</strong>
(depends on what the protocol and platform supports).</p><p>Unlike the <a href="#send/2">send/2</a> function,
this one sends <em>one message</em>.
This means that if, for whatever reason, its not possible to send the
message in one go, the function will instead return with the
<em>remaining</em> data (<strong>{ok, Remaining}</strong>). Thereby leaving it
up to the caller to decide what to do (retry with the remaining data
of give up). </p><h2>sendto/3</h2><h2>sendto/4</h2><h2>sendto/4</h2><h2>sendto/5</h2><p>Send a message on a socket.</p><p>Send a message on a socket, to the specified destination.</p><h2>setopt/4</h2><h2>setopt/4</h2><h2>setopt/4</h2><h2>setopt/4</h2><h2>setopt/4</h2><h2>setopt/4</h2><h2>setopt/4</h2><p>Set options on a socket.</p><p>Set options on a socket.</p><p>What properties are valid depend both on <strong>Level</strong> and on
