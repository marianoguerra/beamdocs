The exact details (for example, whether <strong>erl</strong> is a
script or a program and which other programs it calls) are
system-dependent.Windows users probably want to use the <strong>werl</strong> program
instead, which runs in its own window with scrollbars and supports
command-line editing. The <strong>erl</strong> program on Windows
provides no line editing in its shell, and on Windows 95 there is no way
to scroll back to text that has scrolled off the screen. The
<strong>erl</strong> program must be used, however, in pipelines or if
you want to redirect standard input or output.</p><h1>Functions</h1><h2>erl &lt;arguments&gt;</h2><p>Start an Erlang runtime system.</p><p>Starts an Erlang runtime system.</p><p>The arguments can be divided into <em>emulator flags</em>,
<em>flags</em>, and <em>plain arguments</em>:</p><ul><li> <p>Any argument starting with character <strong>+</strong> is
interpreted as an
<a href="#emu_flags">emulator flag</a>.</p> <p>As indicated by the name, emulator flags control
the behavior of the emulator.</p> </li><li> <p>Any argument starting with character <strong>-</strong>
(hyphen) is interpreted as a
<a href="#init_flags">flag</a>, which is to
be passed to the Erlang part of the runtime system, more
specifically to the <strong>init</strong> system process, see
<a href="init">init</a>.</p> <p>The <strong>init</strong> process itself interprets some of
these flags, the <em>init flags</em>. It also stores any
remaining flags, the <em>user flags</em>. The latter can be
retrieved by calling <strong>init:get_argument/1</strong>.</p> <p>A small number of "-" flags exist, which now actually are
emulator flags, see the description below.</p> </li><li> <p>Plain arguments are not interpreted in any way. They are also
stored by the <strong>init</strong> process and can be retrieved
by calling <strong>init:get_plain_arguments/0</strong>.
Plain arguments can occur before the first flag, or after a
<strong>--</strong> flag. Also, the <strong>-extra</strong>
flag causes everything that follows to become plain arguments.</p> </li></ul><p><em>Examples:</em></p><pre>
% <span class="input">erl +W w -sname arnie +R 9 -s my_init -extra +bertie</span>
(arnie@host)1&gt; <span class="input">init:get_argument(sname).</span>
{ok,[["arnie"]]}
(arnie@host)2&gt; <span class="input">init:get_plain_arguments().</span>
["+bertie"]</pre><p>Here <strong>+W w</strong> and <strong>+R 9</strong> are
emulator flags. <strong>-s my_init</strong> is an init flag,
interpreted by <strong>init</strong>.
<strong>-sname arnie</strong> is a user flag, stored by
<strong>init</strong>. It is read by Kernel and causes the
Erlang runtime system to become distributed. Finally, everything after
<strong>-extra</strong> (that is, <strong>+bertie</strong>) is
considered as plain arguments.</p><pre>

2&gt; <span class="input">init:get_plain_arguments().</span>
[]</pre><p>Here the user flag <strong>-myflag 1</strong> is passed to and
stored by the <strong>init</strong> process. It is a user-defined
flag, presumably used by some user-defined application.</p><a name="init_flags"></a><h2>Flags</h2><p>In the following list, init flags are marked "(init flag)".
Unless otherwise specified, all other flags are user flags, for
which the values can be retrieved by calling
<strong>init:get_argument/1</strong>. Notice that the list of user
flags is not exhaustive, there can be more application-specific
flags that instead are described in the corresponding
application documentation.</p><dl><dt><strong>--</strong> (init flag)</dt><dd> <p>Everything following <strong>--</strong> up to the next flag
(<strong>-flag</strong> or <strong>+flag</strong>) is considered
plain arguments and can be retrieved using
<strong>init:get_plain_arguments/0</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-Application Par Val</strong></dt><dd> <p>Sets the application configuration parameter <strong>Par</strong>
to the value <strong>Val</strong> for the application
<strong>Application</strong>; see
<a href="./app">kernel/app</a> and
<a href="./application">kernel/application</a>.</p> </dd><dt><a name="args_file"></a><strong>-args_file FileName</strong></dt><dd> <p>Command-line arguments are read from the file
<strong>FileName</strong>. The arguments read from the file replace
flag '<strong>-args_file FileName</strong>' on the resulting
command line.</p> <p>The file <strong>FileName</strong> is to be a plain text file and
can contain comments and command-line arguments. A comment begins
with a <strong>#</strong> character and continues until the next end of line
character. Backslash (\\) is used as quoting character. All
command-line arguments accepted by <strong>erl</strong> are allowed,
also flag <strong>-args_file FileName</strong>. Be careful not to
cause circular dependencies between files containing flag
<strong>-args_file</strong>, though.</p> <p>The flag <strong>-extra</strong> is treated in special way. Its
scope ends at the end of the file. Arguments following an
<strong>-extra</strong> flag are moved on the command line into the
<strong>-extra</strong> section, that is, the end of the command
line following after an <strong>-extra</strong> flag.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-async_shell_start</strong></dt><dd> <p>The initial Erlang shell does not read user input until
the system boot procedure has been completed (Erlang/OTP 5.4 and
later). This flag disables the start synchronization feature
and lets the shell start in parallel with the rest of
the system.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-boot File</strong></dt><dd> <p>Specifies the name of the boot file, <strong>File.boot</strong>,
which is used to start the system; see
<a href="init">init</a>. Unless
<strong>File</strong> contains an absolute path, the system searches
for <strong>File.boot</strong> in the current and 
<strong>$ROOT/bin</strong> directories.</p> <p>Defaults to <strong>$ROOT/bin/start.boot</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-boot_var Var Dir</strong></dt><dd> <p>If the boot script contains a path variable <strong>Var</strong>
other than <strong>$ROOT</strong>, this variable is expanded to

non-zero exit code if the compilation of some file did not
succeed). Implies <strong>-noinput</strong>.</p> <p>Not recommended; use <a href="erlc">erlc</a>
instead.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-config Config</strong></dt><dd> <p>Specifies the name of a configuration file,
<strong>Config.config</strong>, which is used to configure
applications; see
<a href="./app">kernel/app</a> and
<a href="./application">kernel/application</a>.</p> </dd><dt><a name="connect_all"></a><strong>-connect_all false</strong></dt><dd> <p>If this flag is present, <strong>global</strong> does not maintain
a fully connected network of distributed Erlang nodes, and then
global name registration cannot be used; see
<a href="./global">kernel/global</a>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-cookie Cookie</strong></dt><dd> <p>Obsolete flag without any effect and common misspelling for
<strong>-setcookie</strong>. Use <strong>-setcookie</strong>
instead.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-detached</strong></dt><dd> <p>Starts the Erlang runtime system detached from the system
console. Useful for running daemons and backgrounds processes. Implies
<strong>-noinput</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-emu_args</strong></dt><dd> <p>Useful for debugging. Prints the arguments sent to the emulator.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-emu_type Type</strong></dt><dd> <p>Start an emulator of a different type. For example, to start
the lock-counter emualator, use <strong>-emu_type lcnt</strong>. (The emulator
must already be built. Use the <strong>configure</strong> option
<strong>--enable-lock-counter</strong> to build the lock-counter emulator.)</p> </dd><dt><strong>-env Variable Value</strong></dt><dd> <p>Sets the host OS environment variable <strong>Variable</strong> to
the value <strong>Value</strong> for the Erlang runtime system.
Example:</p> <pre>
% <span class="input">erl -env DISPLAY gin:0</span></pre> <p>In this example, an Erlang runtime system is started with
environment variable <strong>DISPLAY</strong> set to

arguments and can be retrieved using
<strong>init:get_plain_arguments/0</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-heart</strong></dt><dd> <p>Starts heartbeat monitoring of the Erlang runtime system;
see <a href="./heart">kernel/heart</a>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-hidden</strong></dt><dd> <p>Starts the Erlang runtime system as a hidden node, if it is
run as a distributed node. Hidden nodes always establish
hidden connections to all other nodes except for nodes in the
same global group. Hidden connections are not published on
any of the connected nodes, that is, none of the connected
nodes are part of the result from <strong>nodes/0</strong> on the
other node. See also hidden global groups;
<a href="./global_group">kernel/global_group</a>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-hosts Hosts</strong></dt><dd> <p>Specifies the IP addresses for the hosts on which Erlang boot servers
are running, see <a href="./erl_boot_server">kernel/erl_boot_server</a>. This flag
is mandatory if flag <strong>-loader inet</strong> is present.</p> <p>The IP addresses must be specified in the standard form (four
decimal numbers separated by periods, for example,
<strong>"150.236.20.74"</strong>. Hosts names are not acceptable,
but a broadcast address (preferably limited to the local network)
is.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-id Id</strong></dt><dd> <p>Specifies the identity of the Erlang runtime system. If it is
run as a distributed node, <strong>Id</strong> must be identical to
the name supplied together with flag <strong>-sname</strong> or
<strong>-name</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-init_debug</strong></dt><dd> <p>Makes <strong>init</strong> write some debug information while
interpreting the boot script.</p> </dd><dt><a name="instr"></a><strong>-instr</strong> (emulator flag)</dt><dd> <p>Selects an instrumented Erlang runtime system (virtual
machine) to run, instead of the ordinary one. When running an
instrumented runtime system, some resource usage data can be
obtained and analyzed using the <strong>instrument</strong> module.
Functionally, it behaves exactly like an ordinary Erlang
runtime system.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-loader Loader</strong></dt><dd> <p>Specifies the method used by <strong>erl_prim_loader</strong> to
load Erlang modules into the system; see
<a href="erl_prim_loader">erl_prim_loader</a>.
Two <strong>Loader</strong> methods are supported:</p> <ul><li> <p><strong>efile</strong>, which means use the local file system,
this is the default.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>inet</strong>, which means use a boot server on
another machine. The flags <strong>-id</strong>,
<strong>-hosts</strong> and <strong>-setcookie</strong> must
also be specified.</p> </li></ul> <p>If <strong>Loader</strong> is something else, the user-supplied
<strong>Loader</strong> port program is started.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-make</strong></dt><dd> <p>Makes the Erlang runtime system invoke <strong>make:all()</strong>
in the current working directory and then terminate; see
<a href="./make">tools/make</a>. Implies
<strong>-noinput</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-man Module</strong></dt><dd> <p>Displays the manual page for the Erlang module
<strong>Module</strong>. Only supported on Unix.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-mode interactive | embedded</strong></dt><dd> <p>Modules are auto loaded when they are first referenced if the
runtime system runs in <strong>interactive</strong> mode, which is
the default. In <strong>embedded</strong> mode modules are not auto
loaded. The latter is recommended when the boot script preloads all
modules, as conventionally happens in OTP releases. See
<a href="./code">kernel/code</a></p>. </dd><dt><strong>-name Name</strong></dt><dd> <p>Makes the Erlang runtime system into a distributed node.
This flag invokes all network servers necessary for a node to
become distributed; see <a href="./net_kernel">kernel/net_kernel</a>. It is also ensured that
<strong>epmd</strong> runs on the current host before Erlang is
started; see <a href="epmd">epmd</a>.and the
<a href="#start_epmd">start_epmd</a> option.</p> <p>The node name will be <strong>Name@Host</strong>, where
<strong>Host</strong> is the fully qualified host name of the
current host. For short names, use flag <strong>-sname</strong>
instead.</p> <div class="alert alert-warning"><h4 class="alert-heading">Warning</h4><p>
Starting a distributed node without also specifying
<a href="#proto_dist">proto_dist</a>
will expose the node to attacks that may give the attacker
complete access to the node and in extension the cluster.
When using un-secure distributed nodes, make sure that the
network is configured to keep potential attackers out.

             {core,{logical,3}}]}]</pre> <p>A more complicated example with two quad core
processors, each processor in its own NUMA node.
The ordering of logical processors is a bit weird.
This to give a better example of identifier lists:</p> <pre>
% <span class="input">erl +sct L0-1,3-2c0-3p0N0:L7,4,6-5c0-3p1N1</span>

to pass a CPU topology that is not a correct
description of the CPU topology. When used with
care this can be very useful. This
to trick the emulator to bind its schedulers
as you want. For example, if you want to run multiple
Erlang runtime systems on the same machine, you
want to reduce the number of schedulers used and
manipulate the CPU topology so that they bind to
different logical CPUs. An example, with two Erlang
runtime systems on a quad core machine:</p> <pre>
% <span class="input">erl +sct L0-3c0-3 +sbt db +S3:2 -detached -noinput -noshell -sname one</span>

schedulers each online, and all schedulers online
will run on different cores. If we change to one
scheduler online on one runtime system, and three
schedulers online on the other, all schedulers
online will still run on different cores.</p> <p>Notice that a faked CPU topology that does not reflect

scheduler utilization balancing is disabled and instead scheduler
compaction of load is enabled, which strives for a load
distribution that causes as many scheduler threads as possible

utilization balancing is enabled, the system instead tries to
balance scheduler utilization between schedulers. That is,
strive for equal scheduler utilization on all schedulers.</p> <p><strong>+sub true</strong> is only supported on systems where the runtime
system detects and uses a monotonically increasing high-resolution
clock. On other systems, the runtime system fails to start.</p> <p><strong>+sub true</strong> implies <a href="#+scl">+scl</a>. The difference between

Controls how eager schedulers are to be requesting
wakeup because of certain cleanup operations. When a lazy setting
is used, more outstanding cleanup operations can be left undone
while a scheduler is idling. When an eager setting is used,
schedulers are more frequently woken, potentially increasing

The threshold determines when to wake up sleeping schedulers
when more work than can be handled by currently awake schedulers
exists. A low threshold causes earlier wakeups, and a high
threshold causes later wakeups. Early wakeups distribute work
over multiple schedulers faster, but work does more easily bounce
