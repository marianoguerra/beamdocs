mutable atomic variables. The implementation utilizes only
atomic hardware instructions without any software level locking, which makes
it very efficient for concurrent access. The atomics are organized into
arrays with the following semantics:<ul><li> <p>Atomics are 64 bit integers.</p> </li><li> <p>Atomics can be represented as either signed or unsigned.</p> </li><li> <p>Atomics wrap around at overflow and underflow operations.</p> </li><li> <p>All operations guarantee atomicity. No intermediate results can be
seen. The result of one mutation can only be the input to one
following mutation.</p> </li><li> <p>All atomic operations are mutually ordered. If atomic B is updated
<em>after</em> atomic A, then that is how it will appear to any
concurrent readers. No one can read the new value of B and then read the
old value of A.</p> </li><li> <p>Indexes into atomic arrays are one-based. An atomic array of
arity N contains N atomics with index from 1 to N.</p> </li></ul></p><h2>Data Types</h2><span class="name">atomics_ref</span><p>Identifies an atomic array returned from

shared mutable counter variables. The implementation does not utilize any
software level locking, which makes it very efficient for concurrent
access. The counters are organized into arrays with the following
semantics:<ul><li> <p>Counters are 64 bit signed integers.</p> </li><li> <p>Counters wrap around at overflow and underflow operations.</p> </li><li><p>Counters are initialized to zero and can then only be written to
by adding or subtracting.</p> </li><li> <p>Write operations guarantee atomicity. No intermediate results can be
seen from a single write operation.</p> </li><li> <p>Two types of counter arrays can be created with options <strong>atomics</strong> or
<strong>write_concurrency</strong>. The <strong>atomics</strong> counters have good allround
performance with nice consistent semantics while
<strong>write_concurrency</strong> counters offers even better concurrent
write performance at the expense of some potential read
inconsistencies. See <a href="#new/2">new/2</a>.</p> </li><li> <p>Indexes into counter arrays are one-based. A counter array of
size N contains N counters with index from 1 to N.</p> </li></ul></p><h2>Data Types</h2><span class="name">counters_ref</span><p>Identifies a counter array returned from

regard to concurrent write operations. Even if write operation A is done
sequentially before write operation B, a concurrent reader may see any
combination of A and B, including only B. A read operation is only
guaranteed to see all writes done sequentially before the read. No writes
are ever lost, but will eventually all be seen.</p> <p>The typical use case for <strong>write_concurrency</strong> is when
concurrent calls to <a href="#add/3">add/3</a> and
<a href="#sub/3">sub/3</a> toward the same counters
are very frequent, while calls to <a href="#get/2">get/2</a> and <a href="#put/3">put/3</a> are much

has been changed with larger types for the callbacks
<a href="#output">output</a>,
<a href="#control">control</a>, and
<a href="#call">call</a>.
See driver <a href="./erl_driver#version_management"> version management</a> in
<a href="erl_driver">erl_driver</a>.The <strong>driver_entry</strong> structure is a C struct that all Erlang
drivers define. It contains entry points for the Erlang driver,
which are called by the Erlang emulator when Erlang code accesses
the driver.<a name="emulator"></a>
The <a href="erl_driver">erl_driver</a> driver
API functions need a port handle
that identifies the driver instance (and the port in the
emulator). This is only passed to the <strong>start</strong> function, but
not to the other functions. The <strong>start</strong> function returns a
driver-defined handle that is passed to the other functions. A
common practice is to have the <strong>start</strong> function allocate
some application-defined structure and stash the <strong>port</strong>
handle in it, to use it later with the driver API functions.The driver callback functions are called synchronously from the
Erlang emulator. If they take too long before completing, they
can cause time-outs in the emulator. Use the queue or
asynchronous calls if necessary, as the emulator must be
responsive.The driver structure contains the driver name and some
15 function pointers, which are called at different
times by the emulator.The only exported function from the driver is
<strong>driver_init</strong>. This function returns the <strong>driver_entry</strong>
structure that points to the other functions in the driver. The
<strong>driver_init</strong> function is declared with a macro,
<strong>DRIVER_INIT(drivername)</strong>. (This is because different
operating systems have different names for it.)When writing a driver in C++, the driver entry is to be of
<strong>"C"</strong> linkage. One way to do this is to put the
following line somewhere before the driver entry:<pre>
extern "C" DRIVER_INIT(drivername);</pre>When the driver has passed the <strong>driver_entry</strong> over to
the emulator, the driver is <em>not</em> allowed to modify the
<strong>driver_entry</strong>.If compiling a driver for static inclusion through
<strong>--enable-static-drivers</strong>, you must define
<strong>STATIC_ERLANG_DRIVER</strong> before the <strong>DRIVER_INIT</strong> declaration.</p><h3>Data Types</h3><p><strong>ErlDrvEntry</strong></p><pre><code class="">

something that the <strong>select</strong> system call understands).</p> <p>On Windows the <strong>event</strong> is an <strong>Event</strong> or <strong>Semaphore</strong>

It works a little like an "ioctl" for
Erlang drivers. The data specified to <strong>port_control/3</strong>
arrives in <strong>buf</strong> and <strong>len</strong>. The driver can send
data back, using <strong>*rbuf</strong> and <strong>rlen</strong>.</p> <p>This is the fastest way of calling a driver and get a
response. It makes no context switch in the Erlang
emulator and requires no message passing. It is suitable
for calling C function to get faster execution, when Erlang
is too slow.</p> <p>If the driver wants to return data, it is to return it in
<strong>rbuf</strong>. When <strong>control</strong> is called,
<strong>*rbuf</strong> points to a default buffer of <strong>rlen</strong> bytes, which
can be used to return data. Data is returned differently depending on
the port control flags (those that are set with
<a href="./erl_driver#set_port_control_flags">erl_driver#set_port_control_flags</a>).</p> <p>If the flag is set to <strong>PORT_CONTROL_FLAG_BINARY</strong>,
a binary is returned. Small binaries can be returned by writing
the raw data into the default buffer. A binary can also be
returned by setting <strong>*rbuf</strong> to point to a binary allocated with
<a href="./erl_driver#driver_alloc_binary">erl_driver#driver_alloc_binary</a>.
This binary is freed automatically after <strong>control</strong> has returned.
The driver can retain the binary for <em>read only</em> access with
<a href="./erl_driver#driver_binary_inc_refc">erl_driver#driver_binary_inc_refc</a> to be freed later
with <a href="./erl_driver#driver_free_binary">erl_driver#driver_free_binary</a>.
It is never allowed to change the binary after <strong>control</strong> has
returned. If <strong>*rbuf</strong> is set to <strong>NULL</strong>, an empty list is
returned.</p> <p>If the flag is set to <strong>0</strong>, data is returned as a
list of integers. Either use the default buffer or set
<strong>*rbuf</strong> to point to a larger buffer allocated with
<a href="./erl_driver#driver_alloc">erl_driver#driver_alloc</a>. The
buffer is freed automatically after <strong>control</strong> has returned.</p> <p>Using binaries is faster if more than a few bytes are returned.</p> <p>The return value is the number of bytes returned in <strong>*rbuf</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><a name="timeout"></a><strong>void (*timeout)(ErlDrvData drv_data)</strong> </dt><dd> <p>Called any time after the driver's timer reaches <strong>0</strong>.
The timer is activated with
<a href="./erl_driver#driver_set_timer">erl_driver#driver_set_timer</a>. No priorities or
ordering exist among drivers, so if several drivers time out at
the same time, anyone of them is called first.</p> </dd><dt><a name="outputv"></a> <strong>void (*outputv)(ErlDrvData drv_data, ErlIOVec *ev)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Called whenever the port is written to. If
it is <strong>NULL</strong>, the <strong>output</strong> function is called
instead. This function is faster than <strong>output</strong>, as
it takes an <strong>ErlIOVec</strong> directly, which requires no
copying of the data. The port is to be in binary mode, see
<a href="./erlang#open_port/2">erlang#open_port/2</a>.</p> <p><strong>ErlIOVec</strong> contains both a <strong>SysIOVec</strong>,
suitable for <strong>writev</strong>, and one or more binaries. If
these binaries are to be retained when the driver returns
from <strong>outputv</strong>, they can be queued (using, for example,
<a href="./erl_driver#driver_enq_bin">erl_driver#driver_enq_bin</a>)
or, if they are kept in a static or global
variable, the reference counter can be incremented.</p> </dd><dt><a name="ready_async"></a> <strong>void (*ready_async)(ErlDrvData drv_data, ErlDrvThreadData thread_data)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Called after an asynchronous call has completed.
The asynchronous call is started with
<a href="./erl_driver#driver_async">erl_driver#driver_async</a>.
This function is called from the Erlang emulator thread, as
opposed to the asynchronous function, which is called in
some thread (if multi-threading is enabled).</p> </dd><dt><strong>void (*flush)(ErlDrvData drv_data)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Called when the port is about to be closed,
and there is data in the driver queue that must be flushed
before 'stop' can be called.</p> </dd><dt><a name="call"></a><strong>ErlDrvSSizeT (*call)(ErlDrvData drv_data, unsigned int command, char *buf, ErlDrvSizeT len, char **rbuf, ErlDrvSizeT rlen, unsigned int *flags)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Called from <a href="./erlang#port_call/3">erlang#port_call/3</a>.
It works a lot like the <strong>control</strong> callback, but uses the
external term format for input and output.</p> <p><strong>command</strong> is an integer, obtained from the call from
Erlang (the second argument to <strong>erlang:port_call/3</strong>).</p> <p><strong>buf</strong> and <strong>len</strong> provide the arguments to the call
(the third argument to <strong>erlang:port_call/3</strong>). They can
be decoded using <strong>ei</strong> functions.</p> <p><strong>rbuf</strong> points to a return buffer, <strong>rlen</strong> bytes
long. The return data is to be a valid Erlang term in the
external (binary) format. This is converted to an Erlang
term and returned by <strong>erlang:port_call/3</strong> to the
caller. If more space than <strong>rlen</strong> bytes is needed to
return data, <strong>*rbuf</strong> can be set to memory allocated with
<a href="./erl_driver#driver_alloc">erl_driver#driver_alloc</a>.
This memory is freed automatically after <strong>call</strong> has returned.</p> <p>The return value is the number of bytes returned in
<strong>*rbuf</strong>. If <strong>ERL_DRV_ERROR_GENERAL</strong> is returned
(or in fact, anything &lt; 0), <strong>erlang:port_call/3</strong>

distributed Erlang computations. When an Erlang node starts,
the node has a name and it obtains an address from the host
OS kernel. The name and address are sent to the
<strong>epmd</strong> daemon running on the local host.
In a TCP/IP environment, the address consists
of the IP address and a port number. The node name is
an atom on the form of <strong>Name@Node</strong>.
The job of the <strong>epmd</strong> daemon is to keep track of which
node name listens on which address. Hence, <strong>epmd</strong> maps
symbolic node names to machine addresses.The TCP/IP <strong>epmd</strong> daemon only keeps track of
the <strong>Name</strong> (first) part of an Erlang node name. The <strong>Host</strong>
part (whatever is after the <strong>@</strong>) is implicit in the
node name where the <strong>epmd</strong> daemon was contacted,
as is the IP address where the Erlang node can be
reached. Consistent and correct TCP naming services are
therefore required for an Erlang network to function
correctly.<dl><dt>Starting the port mapper daemon</dt><dd> <p>The daemon is started automatically by command
<a href="erl">erl</a>
if the node is to be distributed and no running
instance is present. If automatically launched
environment variables must be used to change the behavior
of the daemon; see section
<a href="#environment_variables">Environment Variables</a>.</p> <p>If argument <strong>-daemon</strong> is not specified,
<strong>epmd</strong> runs as a normal program with the
controlling terminal of the shell in which it is
started. Normally, it is to be run as a daemon.</p> <p>Regular startup options are described in section

<a href="erl">erl</a> (if not already available),
but it can also be started at system startup.</p><dl><dt><strong>-address List</strong></dt><dd> <p>Lets this instance of <strong>epmd</strong> listen only on the
comma-separated list of IP addresses and on the loopback address
(which is implicitly added to the list if it has not been

useful when the <strong>epmd</strong> daemon is not started as a daemon.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-daemon</strong></dt><dd> <p>Starts <strong>epmd</strong> detached from the controlling terminal. Logging

to be used. It is also used when command <strong>erl</strong> automatically
starts <strong>epmd</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-relaxed_command_check</strong></dt><dd> <p>Starts the <strong>epmd</strong> program with relaxed command checking
(mostly for backward compatibility). This affects the following:</p> <ul><li> <p>With relaxed command checking, the <strong>epmd</strong> daemon can be
killed from the local host with, for example, command
<strong>epmd -kill</strong> even if active nodes are registered. Normally
only daemons with an empty node database can be killed with
<strong>epmd -kill</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p>Command <strong>epmd -stop</strong> (and the corresponding messages to
<strong>epmd</strong>, as can be specified using <a href="./ei">erl_interface/ei</a>) is
normally always ignored. This because it can cause a strange
situation where two nodes of the same name can be alive at the
same time. A node unregisters itself by only closing the
connection to <strong>epmd</strong>, which is why command <strong>stop</strong>
was only intended for use in debugging situations.</p> <p>With relaxed command checking enabled, you can forcibly
unregister live nodes.</p> </li></ul> <p>Relaxed command checking can also be enabled by setting environment
variable <strong>ERL_EPMD_RELAXED_COMMAND_CHECK</strong> before starting

starting the daemon that is to accept killing when it has live
nodes registered. When running <strong>epmd</strong> interactively,
<strong>-relaxed_command_check</strong> has no effect. A daemon that is
started without relaxed command checking must be killed using,
for example, signals or some other OS-specific method if it has
active clients registered.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-stop Name</strong></dt><dd> <p>Forcibly unregisters a live node from the <strong>epmd</strong> database.</p> <p>This command can only be used when contacting <strong>epmd</strong>

list of IP addresses, in which case the <strong>epmd</strong> daemon
will listen only on the specified address(es) and on the

has not been specified). The default behavior is to listen on
all available IP addresses.</p> </dd><dt><strong>ERL_EPMD_PORT</strong></dt><dd> <p>Can contain the port number <strong>epmd</strong> will use.
The default port will work fine in most cases. A different port can
be specified to allow several instances of <strong>epmd</strong>, representing
independent clusters of nodes, to co-exist on the same host.
All nodes in a cluster must use the same <strong>epmd</strong> port number.</p> </dd><dt><strong>ERL_EPMD_RELAXED_COMMAND_CHECK</strong></dt><dd> <p>If set before start, the <strong>epmd</strong> daemon behaves
as if option <strong>-relaxed_command_check</strong> was specified at
startup. Consequently, if this option is set before starting
the Erlang virtual machine, the automatically started
<strong>epmd</strong> accepts the <strong>-kill</strong> and <strong>-stop</strong>
commands without restrictions.</p> </dd></dl><h3>Logging</h3><p>On some operating systems <em>syslog</em> will be used for
error reporting when <strong>epmd</strong> runs as a daemon. To enable
the error logging, you must edit the
<span class="path">/etc/syslog.conf</span> file and add an
entry:</p><pre><code class="">
  !epmd
  *.*&lt;TABs&gt;/var/log/epmd.log
</code></pre><p>where <strong>&lt;TABs&gt;</strong> are at least one real tab character.
Spaces are silently ignored.</p><h3>Access Restrictions</h3><p>The <strong>epmd</strong> daemon accepts messages from both the local host and
remote hosts. However, only the query commands are answered (and
acted upon) if the query comes from a remote host. It is always an
error to try to register a node name if the client is not a process
on the same host as the <strong>epmd</strong> instance is running on. Such
requests are considered hostile and the connection is closed
immediately.</p><p>The following queries are accepted from remote nodes:</p><ul><li> <p>Port queries, that is, on which port the node with a specified
name listens</p> </li><li> <p>Name listing, that is, gives a list of all names registered on
the host</p> </li></ul><p>To restrict access further, firewall software must be used.</p><h2>erl</h2><p>The Erlang emulator.</p><p>The <strong>erl</strong> program starts an Erlang runtime system.
The exact details (for example, whether <strong>erl</strong> is a
script or a program and which other programs it calls) are
system-dependent.Windows users probably want to use the <strong>werl</strong> program
instead, which runs in its own window with scrollbars and supports
command-line editing. The <strong>erl</strong> program on Windows
provides no line editing in its shell, and on Windows 95 there is no way
to scroll back to text that has scrolled off the screen. The
<strong>erl</strong> program must be used, however, in pipelines or if
you want to redirect standard input or output.</p><h2>Functions</h2><h3>erl &lt;arguments&gt;</h3><p>Start an Erlang runtime system.</p><p>Starts an Erlang runtime system.</p><p>The arguments can be divided into <em>emulator flags</em>,

specifically to the <strong>init</strong> system process, see
<a href="init">init</a>.</p> <p>The <strong>init</strong> process itself interprets some of

emulator flags, see the description below.</p> </li><li> <p>Plain arguments are not interpreted in any way. They are also
stored by the <strong>init</strong> process and can be retrieved
by calling <strong>init:get_plain_arguments/0</strong>.

A single quad core processor can be
described as follows:</p> <pre>
% <span class="input">erl +sct L0-3c0-3</span>

[{processor,[{core,{logical,0}},
             {core,{logical,1}},
             {core,{logical,2}},
             {core,{logical,3}}]}]</pre> <p>A more complicated example with two quad core
processors, each processor in its own NUMA node.
The ordering of logical processors is a bit weird.
This to give a better example of identifier lists:</p> <pre>
% <span class="input">erl +sct L0-1,3-2c0-3p0N0:L7,4,6-5c0-3p1N1</span>
1&gt; <span class="input">erlang:system_info(cpu_topology).</span>

                    {core,{logical,6}},
                    {core,{logical,5}}]}]}]</pre> <p>As long as real identifiers are correct, it is OK
to pass a CPU topology that is not a correct
description of the CPU topology. When used with
care this can be very useful. This
to trick the emulator to bind its schedulers
as you want. For example, if you want to run multiple
Erlang runtime systems on the same machine, you
want to reduce the number of schedulers used and
manipulate the CPU topology so that they bind to
different logical CPUs. An example, with two Erlang
runtime systems on a quad core machine:</p> <pre>
% <span class="input">erl +sct L0-3c0-3 +sbt db +S3:2 -detached -noinput -noshell -sname one</span>
% <span class="input">erl +sct L3-0c0-3 +sbt db +S3:2 -detached -noinput -noshell -sname two</span></pre> <p>In this example, each runtime system have two
schedulers each online, and all schedulers online
will run on different cores. If we change to one
scheduler online on one runtime system, and three
schedulers online on the other, all schedulers
online will still run on different cores.</p> <p>Notice that a faked CPU topology that does not reflect
how the real CPU topology looks like is likely to

in this module. Some of the BIFs are viewed more
or less as part of the Erlang programming language and are
<em>auto-imported</em>. Thus, it is not necessary to specify the
module name. For example, the calls <strong>atom_to_list(erlang)</strong>
and <strong>erlang:atom_to_list(erlang)</strong> are identical.Auto-imported BIFs are listed without module prefix.
BIFs listed with module prefix are not auto-imported.BIFs can fail for various reasons. All BIFs fail with
reason <strong>badarg</strong> if they are called with arguments of an
incorrect type. The other reasons are described in the
description of each individual BIF.Some BIFs can be used in guard tests and are marked with
"Allowed in guard tests".</p><h2>Data Types</h2><span class="name">ext_binary</span><p>A binary data object, structured according to

Up until ERTS version 8.*, the check process code operation
checks for all types of references to the old code. That is,
direct references (e.g. return addresses on the process
stack), indirect references (<strong>fun</strong>s in process
context), and references to literals in the code.
</p><p>
As of ERTS version 9.0, the check process code operation
only checks for direct references to the code. Indirect
references via <strong>fun</strong>s will be ignored. If such
<strong>fun</strong>s exist and are used after a purge of the old
code, an exception will be raised upon usage (same as
the case when the <strong>fun</strong> is received by the process
after the purge). Literals will be taken care of (copied)
at a  later stage. This behavior can as of ERTS version
8.1 be enabled when
<a href="../doc/installation_guide/INSTALL#Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Configuring">building OTP</a>,

resumes in <strong><span class="anno">Module</span>:<span class="anno">Function</span></strong> with
the arguments specified by <strong><span class="anno">Args</span></strong> with the call
stack emptied, meaning that the process terminates when that
function returns. Thus <strong>erlang:hibernate/3</strong> never
returns to its caller.</p><p>If the process has any message in its message queue,
the process is awakened immediately in the same way as
described earlier.</p><p>In more technical terms, <strong>erlang:hibernate/3</strong>
discards the call stack for the process,
and then garbage collects the process. After this,
all live data is in one continuous heap. The heap
is then shrunken to the exact same size as the live data
that it holds (even if that size is less than the minimum
heap size for the process).</p><p>If the size of the live data in the process is less than
the minimum heap size, the first garbage collection occurring
after the process is awakened ensures that the heap
size is changed to a size not smaller than the minimum heap
size.</p><p>Notice that emptying the call stack means that any surrounding
<strong>catch</strong> is removed and must be re-inserted after
hibernation. One effect of this is that processes started
using <strong>proc_lib</strong> (also indirectly, such as
<strong>gen_server</strong> processes), are to use
<a href="../stdlib/proc_lib#hibernate/3">stdlib/proc_lib#hibernate/3</a>
instead, to ensure that the exception handler continues to work

Notice that even if

</p><h3>process_flag/2</h3><p>Set process flag message_queue_data for the calling process. </p><ul><li>message_queue_data</li></ul><p>This flag determines how messages in the message queue
are stored, as follows:</p><dl><dt><strong>off_heap</strong></dt><dd> <p><em>All</em> messages in the message queue will be stored
outside of the process heap. This implies that <em>no</em>
messages in the message queue will be part of a garbage
collection of the process.</p> </dd><dt><strong>on_heap</strong></dt><dd> <p>All messages in the message queue will eventually be
placed on heap. They can however temporarily be stored
off heap. This is how messages always have been stored
up until ERTS 8.0.</p> </dd></dl><p>The default <strong>message_queue_data</strong> process flag is determined
by command-line argument <a href="./erl#+hmqd">erl#+hmqd</a> in <strong>erl(1)</strong>.</p><p>If the process potentially can get many messages in its queue,
you are advised to set the flag to <strong>off_heap</strong>. This
because a garbage collection with many messages placed on
the heap can become extremely expensive and the process can
consume large amounts of memory. Performance of the
actual message passing is however generally better when not
using flag <strong>off_heap</strong>.</p><p>When changing this flag messages will be moved. This work
has been initiated but not completed when this function
call returns.</p><p>Returns the old value of the flag.</p><h3>process_flag/2</h3><p>Set process flag priority for the calling process.</p><ul><li>priority_level</li></ul><p>
Sets the process priority. <strong><span class="anno">Level</span></strong> is an atom.
Four priority levels exist: <strong>low</strong>,
<strong>normal</strong>, <strong>high</strong>, and <strong>max</strong>. Default
is <strong>normal</strong>.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>Priority level <strong>max</strong> is reserved for internal use in
the Erlang runtime system, and is <em>not</em> to be used
by others.</p></div><p>Internally in each priority level, processes are scheduled
in a round robin fashion.</p><p>Execution of processes on priority <strong>normal</strong> and
<strong>low</strong> are interleaved. Processes on priority
<strong>low</strong> are selected for execution less
frequently than processes on priority <strong>normal</strong>.</p><p>When runnable processes on priority <strong>high</strong> exist,
no processes on priority <strong>low</strong> or <strong>normal</strong> are
selected for execution. Notice however that this does
<em>not</em> mean that no processes on priority <strong>low</strong>
or <strong>normal</strong> can run when processes
are running on priority <strong>high</strong>. When using multiple
schedulers, more processes can be running
in parallel than processes on priority <strong>high</strong>. That is,
a <strong>low</strong> and a <strong>high</strong> priority process can
execute at the same time.</p><p>When runnable processes on priority <strong>max</strong> exist,
no processes on priority <strong>low</strong>, <strong>normal</strong>, or
<strong>high</strong> are selected for execution. As with priority
<strong>high</strong>, processes on lower priorities can
execute in parallel with processes on priority <strong>max</strong>.</p><p>Scheduling is pre-emptive. Regardless of priority, a process
is pre-empted when it has consumed more than a certain number
of reductions since the last time it was selected for
execution.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>Do not depend on the scheduling
to remain exactly as it is today. Scheduling is likely to be
changed in a future release to use available processor cores better.</p></div><p>There is <em>no</em> automatic mechanism for
avoiding priority inversion, such as priority inheritance
or priority ceilings. When using priorities,
take this into account and handle such scenarios by
yourself.</p><p>Making calls from a <strong>high</strong> priority process into code
that you has no control over can cause the <strong>high</strong>
priority process to wait for a process with lower
priority. That is, effectively decreasing the priority of the
<strong>high</strong> priority process during the call. Even if this
is not the case with one version of the code that you have no
control over, it can be the case in a future
version of it. This can, for example, occur if a
<strong>high</strong> priority process triggers code loading, as
the code server runs on priority <strong>normal</strong>.</p><p>Other priorities than <strong>normal</strong> are normally not needed.
When other priorities are used, use them with care,
<em>especially</em> priority <strong>high</strong>. A
process on priority <strong>high</strong> is only
to perform work for short periods. Busy looping for
long periods in a <strong>high</strong> priority process causes
most likely problems, as important OTP servers
run on priority <strong>normal</strong>.</p><p>Returns the old value of the flag.</p><h3>process_flag/2</h3><p>Set process flag save_calls for the calling process.</p><p><strong><span class="anno">N</span></strong> must be an integer in the interval 0..10000.
If <strong><span class="anno">N</span></strong> &gt; 0, call saving is made
active for the
process. This means that information about the <strong><span class="anno">N</span></strong>
most recent global function calls, BIF calls, sends, and
receives made by the process are saved in a list, which
can be retrieved with
<strong>process_info(Pid, last_calls)</strong>. A global function
call is one in which the module of the function is
explicitly mentioned. Only a fixed amount of information
is saved, as follows:</p><ul><li><p>A tuple <strong>{Module, Function, Arity}</strong> for
function calls</p></li><li><p>The atoms <strong>send</strong>, <strong>'receive'</strong>, and
<strong>timeout</strong> for sends and receives (<strong>'receive'</strong>
when a message is received and <strong>timeout</strong> when a
receive times out)</p></li></ul><p>If <strong>N</strong> = 0,
call saving is disabled for the process, which is the
default. Whenever the size of the call saving list is set,
its contents are reset.</p><p>Returns the old value of the flag.</p><h3>process_flag/2</h3><p>Set process flag sensitive for the calling process.</p><p>Sets or clears flag <strong>sensitive</strong> for the current process.
When a process has been marked as sensitive by calling
<strong>process_flag(sensitive, true)</strong>, features in the runtime
system that can be used for examining the data or inner working
of the process are silently disabled.</p><p>Features that are disabled include (but are not limited to)
the following:</p><ul><li><p>Tracing. Trace flags can still be set for the process,
but no trace messages of any kind are generated. (If flag
<strong>sensitive</strong> is turned off, trace messages are again
generated if any trace flags are set.)</p></li><li><p>Sequential tracing. The sequential trace token is
propagated as usual, but no sequential trace messages are
generated.</p></li></ul><p><strong>process_info/1,2</strong> cannot be used to read out the
message queue or the process dictionary (both are returned
as empty lists).</p><p>Stack back-traces cannot be displayed for the process.</p><p>In crash dumps, the stack, messages, and the process dictionary
are omitted.</p><p>If <strong>{save_calls,N}</strong> has been set for the process, no
function calls are saved to the call saving list.
(The call saving list is not cleared. Also, send, receive,
and time-out events are still added to the list.)</p><p>Returns the old value of the flag.</p><h3>process_flag/3</h3><p>Set process flags for a process.</p><p>Sets certain flags for the process <strong><span class="anno">Pid</span></strong>,

the message was sent and <strong>false</strong> if the message was not

unreliable remote node without ever blocking the sending
(Erlang) process. If the connection to the remote node
(usually not a real Erlang node, but a node written in C or
Java) is overloaded, this function <em>does not send the message</em>
and returns <strong>false</strong>.</p><p>The same occurs if <strong><span class="anno">Dest</span></strong> refers to a local port
that is busy. For all other destinations (allowed for the ordinary
send operator <strong>'!'</strong>), this function sends the message and
returns <strong>true</strong>.</p><p>This function is only to be used in rare circumstances
where a process communicates with Erlang nodes that can
disappear without any trace, causing the TCP buffers and
the drivers queue to be over-full before the node is
shut down (because of tick time-outs) by <strong>net_kernel</strong>.
The normal reaction to take when this occurs is some kind of
premature shutdown of the other node.</p><p>Notice that ignoring the return value from this function would
result in an <em>unreliable</em> message passing, which is
contradictory to the Erlang programming model. The message is
<em>not</em> sent if this function returns <strong>false</strong>.</p><p>In many systems, transient states of
overloaded queues are normal. Although this function
returns <strong>false</strong> does not mean that the other
node is guaranteed to be non-responsive, it could be a
temporary overload. Also, a return value of <strong>true</strong> does
only mean that the message can be sent on the (TCP) channel
without blocking; the message is not guaranteed to
arrive at the remote node. For a disconnected
non-responsive node, the return value is <strong>true</strong> (mimics
the behavior of operator <strong>!</strong>). The expected
behavior and the actions to take when the function
returns <strong>false</strong> are application- and hardware-specific.</p><div class="alert alert-warning"><h4 class="alert-heading">Warning</h4><p>Use with extreme care.</p></div><h3>send_nosuspend/3</h3><p>Try to send a message without ever blocking.</p><ul><li>dst</li></ul><p>The same as

The only option is <strong>noconnect</strong>, which
makes the function return <strong>false</strong> if
the remote node is not currently reachable by the local
node. The normal behavior is to try to connect to the node,
which can stall the process during a short period. The use of
option <strong>noconnect</strong> makes it possible to be
sure not to get the slightest delay when
sending to a remote process. This is especially useful when
communicating with nodes that expect to always be
the connecting part (that is, nodes written in C or Java).</p><p>Whenever the function returns <strong>false</strong> (either when a

the returned information
more or less speaks for itself, but it can be worth
explaining some things. Call counts are presented by two

value is calls. <strong>mbcs</strong> and <strong>sbcs</strong> denote
multi-block carriers, and single-block carriers,
respectively. Sizes are presented in bytes. When a
size is not presented, it is the amount of something.

all compilers in the Erlang system.
Depending on the extension of each input file, <strong>erlc</strong>
invokes the appropriate compiler.
Regardless of which compiler is used, the same flags are used to provide
parameters, such as include paths and output directory.The current working directory, <strong>"."</strong>, is not included
in the code path when running the compiler. This to avoid loading
Beam files from the current working directory that could potentially
be in conflict with the compiler or the Erlang/OTP system used by the
compiler.</p><h2>Functions</h2><h3>erlc flags file1.ext file2.ext...</h3><p>Compile files.</p><p>Compiles one or more files. The files must include the extension,
for example, <strong>.erl</strong> for Erlang source code, or
<strong>.yrl</strong> for Yecc source code.
<strong>Erlc</strong> uses the extension to invoke the correct
compiler.</p><h3>Generally Useful Flags</h3><p>The following flags are supported:</p><dl><dt><strong>-I &lt;Directory&gt;</strong></dt><dd> <p>Instructs the compiler to search for include files in
the <strong>Directory</strong>. When encountering an
<strong>-include</strong> or <strong>-include_lib</strong>
directive, the compiler searches for header files in the following
directories:</p> <ul><li> <p><strong>"."</strong>, the current working directory of the
file server</p> </li><li> <p>The base name of the compiled file</p> </li><li> <p>The directories specified using option <strong>-I</strong>;
the directory specified last is searched first</p> </li></ul> </dd><dt><strong>-o &lt;Directory&gt;</strong></dt><dd> <p>The directory where the compiler is to place the output files.
Defaults to the current working directory.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-D&lt;Name&gt;</strong></dt><dd> <p>Defines a macro.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-D&lt;Name&gt;=&lt;Value&gt;</strong></dt><dd> <p>Defines a macro with the specified value.
The value can be any Erlang term.
Depending on the platform, the value may need to be
quoted if the shell itself interprets certain characters.
On Unix, terms containing tuples and lists
must be quoted. Terms containing spaces
must be quoted on all platforms.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-W&lt;Error&gt;</strong></dt><dd> <p>Makes all warnings into errors.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-W&lt;Number&gt;</strong></dt><dd> <p>Sets warning level to <strong>Number</strong>. Defaults to
<strong>1</strong>. To turn off warnings,
use <strong>-W0</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-W</strong></dt><dd> <p>Same as <strong>-W1</strong>. Default.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-v</strong></dt><dd> <p>Enables verbose output.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-b &lt;Output_type&gt;</strong></dt><dd> <p>Specifies the type of output file.
<strong>Output_type</strong> is the same as the file extension
of the output file, but without the period.
This option is ignored by compilers that have
a single output format.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-smp</strong></dt><dd> <p>Compiles using the SMP emulator. This is mainly useful
for compiling native code, which must be compiled with the same
runtime system that it is to be run on.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-M</strong></dt><dd> <p>Produces a Makefile rule to track header dependencies. The
rule is sent to <strong>stdout</strong>. No object file is produced.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-MMD</strong></dt><dd> <p>Generate dependencies as a side-effect. The object file
will be produced as normal. This option overrides the
option <strong>-M</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-MF &lt;Makefile&gt;</strong></dt><dd> <p>As option <strong>-M</strong>, except that the
Makefile is written to <strong>Makefile</strong>. No object
file is produced.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-MD</strong></dt><dd> <p>Same as <strong>-M -MF &lt;File&gt;.Pbeam</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-MT &lt;Target&gt;</strong></dt><dd> <p>In conjunction with option <strong>-M</strong> or
<strong>-MF</strong>, changes the name of the rule emitted
to <strong>Target</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-MQ &lt;Target&gt;</strong></dt><dd> <p>As option <strong>-MT</strong>, except that characters special to
<strong>make/1</strong> are quoted.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-MP</strong></dt><dd> <p>In conjunction with option <strong>-M</strong> or
<strong>-MF</strong>, adds a phony target for each dependency.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-MG</strong></dt><dd> <p>In conjunction with option <strong>-M</strong> or
<strong>-MF</strong>, considers missing headers as generated
files and adds them to the dependencies.</p> </dd><dt><strong>--</strong></dt><dd> <p>Signals that no more options will follow.
The rest of the arguments is treated as filenames,
even if they start with hyphens.</p> </dd><dt><strong>+&lt;Term&gt;</strong></dt><dd> <p>A flag starting with a plus (<strong>+</strong>) rather than a hyphen
is converted to an Erlang term and passed unchanged to
the compiler.
For example, option <strong>export_all</strong> for the Erlang
compiler can be specified as follows:</p> <pre>
erlc +export_all file.erl</pre> <p>Depending on the platform, the value may need to be
quoted if the shell itself interprets certain characters.
On Unix, terms containing tuples and lists
must be quoted. Terms containing spaces
must be quoted on all platforms.</p> </dd></dl><h3>Special Flags</h3><p>The following flags are useful in special situations,

callback functions that the Erlang Virtual Machine calls when certain
events occur. There can be multiple instances of a driver, each
instance is associated with an Erlang port.<a name="WARNING"></a>As from ERTS 5.5.3 the driver interface has been extended
(see <a href="./driver_entry#extended_marker">driver_entry#extended_marker</a>). The extended interface introduces
<a href="#version_management">version management</a>,
the possibility to pass capability flags (see
<a href="./driver_entry#driver_flags">driver_entry#driver_flags</a>) to the runtime system at driver
initialization, and some new driver API functions.The driver calls back to the emulator, using the API
functions declared in <strong>erl_driver.h</strong>. They are used for
outputting data from the driver, using timers, and so on.Each driver instance is associated with a port. Every port
has a port owner process. Communication with the port is normally
done through the port owner process. Most of the functions take
the <strong>port</strong> handle as an argument. This identifies the driver
instance. Notice that this port handle must be stored by the driver,
it is not given when the driver is called from the emulator (see
<a href="./driver_entry#emulator">driver_entry#emulator</a>).Some of the functions take a parameter of type
<strong>ErlDrvBinary</strong>, a driver binary. It is to be both
allocated and freed by the caller. Using a binary directly avoids
one extra copying of data.Many of the output functions have a "header buffer", with
<strong>hbuf</strong> and <strong>hlen</strong> parameters. This buffer is sent as a
list before the binary (or list, depending on port mode) that is
sent. This is convenient when matching on messages received from
the port. (Although in the latest Erlang versions there is
the binary syntax, which enables you to match on the beginning of
a binary.)<a name="smp_support"></a>In the runtime system with
SMP support, drivers are locked either on driver level
or port level (driver instance level). By default
driver level locking will be used, that is, only one emulator thread
will execute code in the driver at a time. If port level locking
is used, multiple emulator threads can execute code in the driver
at the same time. Only one thread at a time will call
driver callbacks corresponding to the same port, though.
To enable port level locking, set the <strong>ERL_DRV_FLAG_USE_PORT_LOCKING</strong>
<a href="./driver_entry#driver_flags">driver flag</a> in
the <a href="driver_entry">driver_entry</a>
used by the driver. When port level locking is used,
the driver writer is responsible for synchronizing all accesses
to data shared by the ports (driver instances).Most drivers written before the runtime system with SMP
support existed can run in the runtime system
with SMP support, without being rewritten, if driver
level locking is used.Previously, in the runtime system without SMP support,
specific driver callbacks were always called from the same
thread. This is <em>not</em> the case in the runtime system
with SMP support. Regardless of locking scheme used, calls
to driver callbacks can be made from different threads. For example,
two consecutive calls to exactly the same callback for exactly
the same port can be made from two different threads. This
is for <em>most</em> drivers not a problem, but it can be.
Drivers that depend on all callbacks that are called in the
same thread, <em>must</em> be rewritten before they are used
in the runtime system with SMP support.Most functions in this API are <em>not</em> thread-safe, that is,
they <em>cannot</em> be called from arbitrary threads. Functions
that are not documented as thread-safe can only be called from
driver callbacks or function calls descending from a driver
callback call. Notice that driver callbacks can be called from
different threads. This, however, is not a problem for any
function in this API, as the emulator has control over
these threads.<a name="lengthy_work"></a>
As mentioned in the <a href="#WARNING">warning</a> text at
the beginning of this section, it is of vital importance that a driver
callback returns relatively fast. It is difficult to give an exact
maximum amount of time that a driver callback is allowed to work, but
usually a well-behaving driver callback is to return within 1 millisecond.
This can be achieved using different approaches.
If you have full control over the code to execute in the driver
callback, the best approach is to divide the work into multiple chunks of
work, and trigger multiple calls to the
<a href="./driver_entry#timeout">time-out callback</a> using
zero time-outs. Function <a href="#erl_drv_consume_timeslice">erl_drv_consume_timeslice</a> can be useful to
determine when to trigger such time-out callback calls. However, sometimes
it cannot be implemented this way, for example when calling
third-party libraries. In this case, you typically want to dispatch the
work to another thread. Information about thread primitives is provided
below.</p><h3>Functionality</h3><p>All functions that a driver needs to do with Erlang are
performed through driver API functions. Functions exist
for the following functionality:</p><dl><dt>Timer functions</dt><dd> <p>Control the timer that a driver can use. The timer has the
emulator call the <a href="./driver_entry#timeout">driver_entry#timeout</a> entry function after a specified time.
Only one timer is available for each driver instance.</p> </dd><dt>Queue handling</dt><dd> <p>Every driver instance has an associated queue. This queue is a
<strong>SysIOVec</strong>, which works as a buffer. It is mostly used for
the driver to buffer data that is to be written to a device,
it is a byte stream. If the port owner process closes the
driver, and the queue is not empty, the driver is not
closed. This enables the driver to flush its buffers before
closing.</p> <p>The queue can be manipulated from any threads if
a port data lock is used. For more information, see
<a href="#ErlDrvPDL">ErlDrvPDL</a>.</p> </dd><dt>Output functions</dt><dd> <p>With these functions, the driver sends data back to the emulator.
The data is received as messages by the port owner process, see
<a href="./erlang#open_port/2">erlang#open_port/2</a>. The vector function and the
function taking a driver binary are faster, as they avoid
copying the data buffer. There is also a fast way of sending
terms from the driver, without going through the binary term
format.</p></dd><dt>Failure</dt><dd> <p>The driver can exit and signal errors up to Erlang. This is
only for severe errors, when the driver cannot possibly keep
open.</p> </dd><dt>Asynchronous calls</dt><dd> <p>Erlang/OTP R7B and later versions have provision for
asynchronous function calls, using a thread pool provided by
Erlang. There is also a select call, which can be used for
asynchronous drivers.</p> </dd><dt><a name="multi_threading"></a>Multi-threading</dt><dd> <p>A POSIX thread like API for multi-threading is provided. The
Erlang driver thread API only provides a subset of the functionality
provided by the POSIX thread API. The subset provided is
more or less the basic functionality needed for multi-threaded
programming:</p> <ul><li><a href="#ErlDrvTid">Threads</a></li><li><a href="#ErlDrvMutex">Mutexes</a></li><li><a href="#ErlDrvCond"> Condition variables</a></li><li><a href="#ErlDrvRWLock"> Read/write locks</a></li><li><a href="#ErlDrvTSDKey"> Thread-specific data</a></li></ul> <p>The Erlang driver thread API can be used in conjunction with
the POSIX thread API on UN-ices and with the Windows native thread
API on Windows. The Erlang driver thread API has the advantage of
being portable, but there can exist situations where you want to
use functionality from the POSIX thread API or the Windows
native thread API.</p> <p>The Erlang driver thread API only returns error codes when it is
reasonable to recover from an error condition. If it is not reasonable
to recover from an error condition, the whole runtime system is
terminated. For example, if a create mutex operation fails, an error
code is returned, but if a lock operation on a mutex fails, the
whole runtime system is terminated.</p> <p>Notice that there is no "condition variable wait with time-out" in
the Erlang driver thread API. This because of issues with
<strong>pthread_cond_timedwait</strong>. When the system clock suddenly
is changed, it is not always guaranteed that you will wake up from
the call as expected. An Erlang runtime system must be able to
cope with sudden changes of the system clock. Therefore, we have
omitted it from the Erlang driver thread API. In the Erlang driver
case, time-outs can and are to be handled with the timer functionality
of the Erlang driver API.</p> <p>In order for the Erlang driver thread API to function, thread
support must be enabled in the runtime system. An Erlang driver
can check if thread support is enabled by use of
<a href="#driver_system_info">driver_system_info</a>.
Notice that some functions in the Erlang driver API are thread-safe
only when the runtime system has SMP support, also this
information can be retrieved through
<a href="#driver_system_info">driver_system_info</a>.
Also notice that many functions in the Erlang driver API are
<em>not</em> thread-safe, regardless of whether SMP support is
enabled or not. If a function is not documented as thread-safe, it
is <em>not</em> thread-safe.</p> <div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>When executing in an emulator thread, it is
<em>very important</em> that you unlock <em>all</em> locks you
have locked before letting the thread out of your control;
otherwise you are <em>very likely</em> to deadlock the whole
emulator.</p><p>If you need to use thread-specific data in an emulator
thread, only have the thread-specific data set while the thread is
under your control, and clear the thread-specific data before
you let the thread out of your control.</p></div> <p>In the future, debug functionality will probably be
integrated with the Erlang driver thread API. All functions
that create entities take a <strong>name</strong> argument. Currently
the <strong>name</strong> argument is unused, but it will be used when
the debug functionality is implemented. If you name all
entities created well, the debug functionality will be able
to give you better error reports.</p> </dd><dt>Adding/removing drivers</dt><dd> <p>A driver can add and later remove drivers.</p> </dd><dt>Monitoring processes</dt><dd> <p>A driver can monitor a process that does not own a port.</p> </dd><dt><a name="version_management"></a>Version management</dt><dd> <p>Version management is enabled for drivers that have set the
<a href="./driver_entry#extended_marker">driver_entry#extended_marker</a> field of their
<a href="driver_entry">driver_entry</a>
to <strong>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MARKER</strong>. <strong>erl_driver.h</strong> defines:</p> <ul><li> <p><strong>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MARKER</strong></p> </li><li> <p><strong>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MAJOR_VERSION</strong>, which is incremented when
driver incompatible changes are made to the Erlang runtime
system. Normally it suffices to recompile drivers when
<strong>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MAJOR_VERSION</strong> has changed, but it
can, under rare circumstances, mean that drivers must
be slightly modified. If so, this will of course be
documented.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MINOR_VERSION</strong>, which is incremented when
new features are added. The runtime system uses the minor version
of the driver to determine what features to use.</p> </li></ul> <p>The runtime system normally refuses to load a driver if the major
versions differ, or if the major versions are equal and the
minor version used by the driver is greater than the one used
by the runtime system. Old drivers with lower major versions
are however allowed after a bump of the major version during
a transition period of two major releases. Such old drivers can,
however, fail if deprecated features are used.</p> <p>The emulator refuses to load a driver that does not use
the extended driver interface, to allow for 64-bit capable drivers,
as incompatible type changes for the callbacks
<a href="./driver_entry#output">driver_entry#output</a>,
<a href="./driver_entry#control">driver_entry#control</a>, and
<a href="./driver_entry#call">driver_entry#call</a>
were introduced in Erlang/OTP R15B. A driver written
with the old types would compile with warnings and when
called return garbage sizes to the emulator, causing it
to read random memory and create huge incorrect result blobs.</p> <p>Therefore it is not enough to only recompile drivers written with
version management for pre R15B types; the types must be changed
in the driver suggesting other rewrites, especially regarding size
variables. <em>Investigate all warnings when recompiling.</em></p> <p>Also, the API driver functions <strong>driver_output*</strong> and
<strong>driver_vec_to_buf</strong>, <strong>driver_alloc/realloc*</strong>, and the
<strong>driver_*</strong> queue functions were changed to have
larger length arguments and return values. This is a
lesser problem, as code that passes smaller types
gets them auto-converted in the calls, and as long as
the driver does not handle sizes that overflow an <strong>int</strong>,
all will work as before.</p> </dd><dt><a name="time_measurement"></a>Time measurement</dt><dd> <p>Support for time measurement in drivers:</p> <ul><li><a href="#ErlDrvTime">ErlDrvTime</a></li><li><a href="#ErlDrvTimeUnit">ErlDrvTimeUnit</a></li><li><a href="#erl_drv_monotonic_time">erl_drv_monotonic_time</a></li><li><a href="#erl_drv_time_offset">erl_drv_time_offset</a></li><li><a href="#erl_drv_convert_time_unit">erl_drv_convert_time_unit</a></li></ul> </dd></dl><a name="rewrites_for_64_bits"></a><h3>Rewrites for 64-Bit Driver Interface</h3><p>ERTS 5.9 introduced two new integer types,

Hopefully that will generate many important warnings.

dynamically loaded code is dangerous. If the driver code
for the added driver resides in the same dynamically

or <strong>NULL</strong> on failure (out of memory). When a driver binary has
been sent to the emulator, it must not be changed. Every
allocated binary is to be freed by a corresponding call to
<a href="#driver_free_binary">driver_free_binary</a> (unless otherwise stated).</p><p>Notice that a driver binary has an internal reference counter.
This means that calling <strong>driver_free_binary</strong>, it may not
actually dispose of it. If it is sent to the emulator, it can
be referenced there.</p><p>The driver binary has a field, <strong>orig_bytes</strong>, which
marks the start of the data in the binary.</p><p>This function is thread-safe.</p><h3>driver_async(ErlDrvPort port, unsigned

<strong>async_invoke</strong> is invoked in a thread separate from the
emulator thread. This enables the driver to perform
time-consuming, blocking operations without blocking the
emulator.</p><p>The async thread pool size can be set with command-line argument
<a href="./erl#async_thread_pool_size">erl#async_thread_pool_size</a>
in <a href="erl">erl</a>.
If an async thread pool is unavailable, the call is made
synchronously in the thread calling <strong>driver_async</strong>. The
current number of async threads in the async thread pool can be
retrieved through <a href="#driver_system_info">driver_system_info</a>.</p><p>If a thread pool is available, a thread is used.
If argument <strong>key</strong> is <strong>NULL</strong>, the threads from the
pool are used in a round-robin way, each call to
<strong>driver_async</strong> uses the next thread in the pool. With
argument <strong>key</strong> set, this behavior is changed. The two
same values of <strong>*key</strong> always get the same thread.</p><p>To ensure that a driver instance always uses the same
thread, the following call can be used:</p><pre><code class="">
unsigned int myKey = driver_async_port_key(myPort);

r = driver_async(myPort, &amp;myKey, myData, myFunc);    </code></pre><p>It is enough to initialize <strong>myKey</strong> once for each
driver instance.</p><p>If a thread is already working, the calls are
queued up and executed in order. Using the same thread for
each driver instance ensures that the calls are made in sequence.</p><p>The <strong>async_data</strong> is the argument to the functions
<strong>async_invoke</strong> and <strong>async_free</strong>. It is typically a
pointer to a structure containing a pipe or event that
can be used to signal that the async operation completed.
The data is to be freed in <strong>async_free</strong>.</p><p>When the async operation is done,
<a href="./driver_entry#ready_async">driver_entry#ready_async</a> driver

This small default size has been chosen because the
amount of async-threads can be quite large. The
default stack size is enough for drivers delivered
with Erlang/OTP, but is possibly not sufficiently large
for other dynamically linked-in drivers that use the

        event, int mode, int on):int</h3><p>Provides an event for having the emulator call the driver. </p><a name="driver_select"></a><p>This function is used by drivers to provide the emulator with
events to check for. This enables the emulator to call the driver
when something has occurred asynchronously.</p><p>Parameter <strong>event</strong> identifies an OS-specific event object.
On Unix systems, the functions <strong>select</strong>/<strong>poll</strong> are used.
The event object must be a socket or pipe (or other object that
<strong>select</strong>/<strong>poll</strong> can use).
On Windows, the Win32 API function <strong>WaitForMultipleObjects</strong>
is used. This places other restrictions on the event object;
see the Win32 SDK documentation.</p><p>Parameter <strong>on</strong> is to be <strong>1</strong> for setting events
and <strong>0</strong> for clearing them.</p><p>Parameter <strong>mode</strong> is a bitwise OR combination of
<strong>ERL_DRV_READ</strong>, <strong>ERL_DRV_WRITE</strong>, and <strong>ERL_DRV_USE</strong>.
The first two specify whether to wait for read events and/or write
events. A fired read event calls
<a href="./driver_entry#ready_input">driver_entry#ready_input</a> and a fired write event calls
<a href="./driver_entry#ready_output">driver_entry#ready_output</a>.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>Some OS (Windows) do not differentiate between read and write
events. The callback for a fired event then only depends on the
value of <strong>mode</strong>.</p></div><p><strong>ERL_DRV_USE</strong> specifies if we are using the event object or
if we want to close it.
On an emulator with SMP support, it is not safe to clear all events
and then close the event object after <strong>driver_select</strong> has
returned. Another thread can still be using the event object
internally. To safely close an event object, call
<strong>driver_select</strong> with <strong>ERL_DRV_USE</strong> and <strong>on==0</strong>, which
clears all events and then either calls
<a href="./driver_entry#stop_select">driver_entry#stop_select</a>
or schedules it to be called when it is safe to close the event
object. <strong>ERL_DRV_USE</strong> is to be set together with the first event
for an event object. It is harmless to set <strong>ERL_DRV_USE</strong>
even if it already has been done. Clearing all events but keeping
<strong>ERL_DRV_USE</strong> set indicates that we are using the event
object and probably will set events for it again.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p><strong>ERL_DRV_USE</strong> was added in Erlang/OTP R13. Old drivers still
work as before, but it is recommended to update them to use
<strong>ERL_DRV_USE</strong> and <strong>stop_select</strong> to ensure that event
objects are closed in a safe way.</p></div><p>The return value is <strong>0</strong>, unless

busy state of the port message queue.</p><p>The port message queue is set into a busy
state when the amount of command data queued on the
message queue reaches the <strong>high</strong> limit. The port
message queue is set into a not busy state when the
amount of command data queued on the message queue falls
below the <strong>low</strong> limit. Command data is in this
context data passed to the port using either
<strong>Port ! {Owner, {command, Data}}</strong> or
<strong>port_command/[2,3]</strong>. Notice that these limits
only concerns command data that have not yet reached the
port. The <a href="#set_busy_port">busy port</a>
feature can be used for data that has reached the port.</p><p>Valid limits are values in the range
<strong>[ERL_DRV_BUSY_MSGQ_LIM_MIN, ERL_DRV_BUSY_MSGQ_LIM_MAX]</strong>.
Limits are automatically adjusted to be sane. That is,
the system adjusts values so that the low limit used is
lower than or equal to the high limit used. By default the high
limit is 8 kB and the low limit is 4 kB.</p><p>By passing a pointer to an integer variable containing
the value <strong>ERL_DRV_BUSY_MSGQ_READ_ONLY</strong>, the currently used
limit is read and written back to the integer variable.
A new limit can be set by passing a pointer to an integer
variable containing a valid limit. The passed value is
written to the internal limit. The internal limit is then
adjusted. After this the adjusted limit is written
back to the integer variable from which the new value was
read. Values are in bytes.</p><p>The busy message queue feature can be disabled either
by setting the <strong>ERL_DRV_FLAG_NO_BUSY_MSGQ</strong>
<a href="./driver_entry#driver_flags">driver flag</a>
in the <a href="driver_entry">driver_entry</a>
used by the driver, or by calling this function with
<strong>ERL_DRV_BUSY_MSGQ_DISABLED</strong> as a limit (either low or
high). When this feature has been disabled, it cannot be
enabled again. When reading the limits, both are
<strong>ERL_DRV_BUSY_MSGQ_DISABLED</strong> if this
feature has been disabled.</p><p>Processes sending command data to the port are suspended
if either the port is busy or if the port message queue is

improve system responsiveness, and to make it easier to prevent
misbehaviors of the VM because of a port monopolizing a scheduler

section <a href="alt_dist">How to Implement an Alternative Carrier for the Erlang Distribution</a> in the User's Guide</p><h2>erl_nif</h2><p>API functions for an Erlang NIF library.</p><p>A NIF library contains native implementation of some functions
of an Erlang module. The native implemented functions (NIFs) are
called like any other functions without any difference to the
caller. Each NIF must have an implementation in Erlang that
is invoked if the function is called before the NIF library
is successfully loaded. A typical such stub implementation
is to throw an exception. But it can also be used as a fallback
implementation if the NIF library is not implemented for some
architecture.A minimal example of a NIF library can look as follows:<pre><code class="">
/* niftest.c */
#include &lt;erl_nif.h&gt;

static ERL_NIF_TERM hello(ErlNifEnv* env, int argc, const ERL_NIF_TERM argv[])
{
    return enif_make_string(env, "Hello world!", ERL_NIF_LATIN1);
}

static ErlNifFunc nif_funcs[] =
{
    {"hello", 0, hello}
};

ERL_NIF_INIT(niftest,nif_funcs,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL)</code></pre>The Erlang module can look as follows:<pre><code class="">
-module(niftest).

-export([init/0, hello/0]).

init() -&gt;
      erlang:load_nif("./niftest", 0).

hello() -&gt;
      "NIF library not loaded".</code></pre>Compile and test can look as follows (on Linux):<pre><code class="">
$&gt; gcc -fPIC -shared -o niftest.so niftest.c -I $ERL_ROOT/usr/include/
$&gt; erl

1&gt; c(niftest).
{ok,niftest}
2&gt; niftest:hello().
"NIF library not loaded"
3&gt; niftest:init().
ok
4&gt; niftest:hello().
"Hello world!"</code></pre>A better solution for a real module is to take advantage of the new
directive <strong>on_load</strong> (see section
<a href="../doc/reference_manual/code_loading#on_load">Running a Function When a Module is Loaded</a> in the Erlang Reference
Manual) to load the NIF library automatically when the module is
loaded.Once loaded, a NIF library is persistent. It will not be unloaded
until the module code version that it belongs to is purged.</p><h3>Functionality</h3><p>All interaction between NIF code and the Erlang runtime system is
performed by calling NIF API functions. Functions exist
for the following functionality:</p><dl><dt>Read and write Erlang terms</dt><dd> <p>Any Erlang terms can be passed to a NIF as function arguments and
be returned as function return values. The terms are of C-type
<a href="#ERL_NIF_TERM">ERL_NIF_TERM</a> and can
only be read or written using API functions. Most functions to read
the content of a term are prefixed <strong>enif_get_</strong> and usually return
<strong>true</strong> (or <strong>false</strong>) if the term is of the expected type (or
not). The functions to write terms are all prefixed <strong>enif_make_</strong>
and usually
return the created <strong>ERL_NIF_TERM</strong>. There are also some functions
to query terms, like <strong>enif_is_atom</strong>, <strong>enif_is_identical</strong>,
and <strong>enif_compare</strong>.</p> <p>All terms of type <strong>ERL_NIF_TERM</strong> belong to an environment of
type <a href="#ErlNifEnv">ErlNifEnv</a>. The
lifetime of a term is controlled by the lifetime of its environment
object. All API functions that read or write terms has the
environment that the term belongs to as the first function
argument.</p> </dd><dt>Binaries</dt><dd> <p>Terms of type binary are accessed with the help of struct type
<a href="#ErlNifBinary">ErlNifBinary</a>,
which contains a pointer (<strong>data</strong>) to the raw binary data and the
length (<strong>size</strong>) of the data in bytes. Both <strong>data</strong> and
<strong>size</strong> are read-only and are only to be written using calls to
API functions. Instances of <strong>ErlNifBinary</strong> are, however, always
allocated by the user (usually as local variables).</p> <p>The raw data pointed to by <strong>data</strong> is only mutable after a call
to <a href="#enif_alloc_binary">enif_alloc_binary</a> or
<a href="#enif_realloc_binary">enif_realloc_binary</a>. All other functions that
operate on a binary leave the data as read-only.
A mutable binary must in the end either be freed with
<a href="#enif_release_binary">enif_release_binary</a>
or made read-only by transferring it to an Erlang term with
<a href="#enif_make_binary">enif_make_binary</a>.
However, it does not have to occur in the same NIF call. Read-only
binaries do not have to be released.</p> <p><a href="#enif_make_new_binary">enif_make_new_binary</a> can be used as a shortcut to
allocate and return a binary in the same NIF call.</p> <p>Binaries are sequences of whole bytes. Bitstrings with an arbitrary
bit length have no support yet.</p> </dd><dt><a name="resource_objects"></a>Resource objects</dt><dd> <p>The use of resource objects is a safe way to return pointers to
native data structures from a NIF. A resource object is
only a block of memory allocated with
<a href="#enif_alloc_resource">enif_alloc_resource</a>.
A handle ("safe pointer") to this memory block can then be returned
to Erlang by the use of
<a href="#enif_make_resource">enif_make_resource</a>.
The term returned by <strong>enif_make_resource</strong> is opaque in nature.
It can be stored and passed between processes, but
the only real end usage is to pass it back as an argument to a NIF.
The NIF can then call <a href="#enif_get_resource">enif_get_resource</a> and get back a pointer to the
memory block, which is guaranteed to still be valid. A resource
object is not deallocated until the last handle term
is garbage collected by the VM and the resource is released with
<a href="#enif_release_resource">enif_release_resource</a>
(not necessarily in that order).</p> <p>All resource objects are created as instances of some <em>resource type</em>. This makes resources from different modules to be
distinguishable. A resource type is created by calling
<a href="#enif_open_resource_type">enif_open_resource_type</a> when a library is loaded.
Objects of that resource type can then later be allocated and
<strong>enif_get_resource</strong> verifies that the resource is of the
expected type. A resource type can have a user-supplied destructor
function, which is automatically called when resources of that type
are released (by either the garbage collector or
<strong>enif_release_resource</strong>). Resource types are uniquely identified
by a supplied name string and the name of the implementing module.</p> <a name="enif_resource_example"></a> <p>The following is a template example of how to create and return a
resource object.</p> <pre><code class="">
ERL_NIF_TERM term;
MyStruct* obj = enif_alloc_resource(my_resource_type, sizeof(MyStruct));

/* initialize struct ... */

term = enif_make_resource(env, obj);

if (keep_a_reference_of_our_own) {
    /* store 'obj' in static variable, private data or other resource object */
}
else {
    enif_release_resource(obj);
    /* resource now only owned by "Erlang" */
}
return term;</code></pre> <p>Notice that once <strong>enif_make_resource</strong> creates the term to
return to Erlang, the code can choose to either keep its own
native pointer to the allocated struct and release it later, or
release it immediately and rely only on the garbage collector
to deallocate the resource object eventually when it collects
the term.</p>  <p>Another use of resource objects is to create binary terms with
user-defined memory management.
<a href="#enif_make_resource_binary">enif_make_resource_binary</a>
creates a binary term that is connected to a resource object. The
destructor of the resource is called when the binary is garbage
collected, at which time the binary data can be released. An example
of this can be a binary term consisting of data from a <strong>mmap</strong>'ed
file. The destructor can then do <strong>munmap</strong> to release the memory
region.</p> <p>Resource types support upgrade in runtime by allowing a loaded NIF
library to take over an already existing resource type and by that
"inherit" all existing objects of that type. The destructor of the
new library is thereafter called for the inherited objects and the
library with the old destructor function can be safely unloaded.
Existing resource objects, of a module that is upgraded, must either
be deleted or taken over by the new NIF library. The unloading of a
library is postponed as long as there exist resource objects with a
destructor function in the library.</p> </dd><dt>Module upgrade and static data</dt><dd> <p>A loaded NIF library is tied to the Erlang module instance
that loaded it. If the module is upgraded, the new module instance
needs to load its own NIF library (or maybe choose not to). The new
module instance can, however, choose to load the exact same NIF library
as the old code if it wants to. Sharing the dynamic library means that
static data defined by the library is shared as well. To avoid
unintentionally shared static data between module instances, each Erlang
module version can keep its own private data. This private data can be
set when the NIF library is loaded and later retrieved by calling
<a href="#enif_priv_data">enif_priv_data</a>.</p> </dd><dt>Threads and concurrency</dt><dd> <p>A NIF is thread-safe without any explicit synchronization as
long as it acts as a pure function and only reads the supplied
arguments. When you write to a shared state either through
static variables or <a href="#enif_priv_data">enif_priv_data</a>, you need to supply your own explicit
synchronization. This includes terms in process independent
environments that are shared between threads. Resource objects also
require synchronization if you treat them as mutable.</p> <p>The library initialization callbacks <strong>load</strong> and
<strong>upgrade</strong> are thread-safe even for shared state data.</p> </dd><dt><a name="version_management"></a>Version Management</dt><dd> <p>When a NIF library is built, information about the NIF API version
is compiled into the library. When a NIF library is loaded, the
runtime system verifies that the library is of a compatible version.
<strong>erl_nif.h</strong> defines the following:</p> <dl><dt><strong>ERL_NIF_MAJOR_VERSION</strong></dt><dd> <p>Incremented when NIF library incompatible changes are made to the
Erlang runtime system. Normally it suffices to recompile the NIF
library when the <strong>ERL_NIF_MAJOR_VERSION</strong> has changed, but it
can, under rare circumstances, mean that NIF libraries must be
slightly modified. If so, this will of course be documented.</p> </dd><dt><strong>ERL_NIF_MINOR_VERSION</strong></dt><dd> <p>Incremented when new features are added. The runtime system uses
the minor version to determine what features to use.</p> </dd></dl> <p>The runtime system normally refuses to load a NIF library if
the major versions differ, or if the major versions are equal and
the minor version used by the NIF library is greater than the one
used by the runtime system. Old NIF libraries with lower major
versions are, however, allowed after a bump of the major version
during a transition period of two major releases. Such old NIF
libraries can however fail if deprecated features are used.</p> </dd><dt><a name="time_measurement"></a>Time Measurement</dt><dd> <p>Support for time measurement in NIF libraries:</p> <ul><li><a href="#ErlNifTime">ErlNifTime</a></li><li><a href="#ErlNifTimeUnit">ErlNifTimeUnit</a></li><li><a href="#enif_monotonic_time">enif_monotonic_time</a></li><li><a href="#enif_time_offset">enif_time_offset</a></li><li><a href="#enif_convert_time_unit">enif_convert_time_unit</a></li></ul> </dd><dt><a name="enif_ioq"></a>I/O Queues</dt><dd> <p>The Erlang nif library contains function for easily working

at the beginning of this manual page, it is of <em>vital importance</em> that a native function returns relatively fast. It is
difficult to give an exact maximum amount of time that a native
function is allowed to work, but usually a well-behaving native
function is to return to its caller within 1 millisecond. This can be
achieved using different approaches. If you have full control over the
code to execute in the native function, the best approach is to
divide the work into multiple chunks of work and call the native
function multiple times. This is, however, not always possible, for
example when calling third-party libraries.</p> <p>The <a href="#enif_consume_timeslice">enif_consume_timeslice</a> function can be used to
inform the runtime system about the length of the NIF call.
It is typically always to be used unless the NIF executes very
fast.</p> <p>If the NIF call is too lengthy, this must be handled in one of
the following ways to avoid degraded responsiveness, scheduler load
balancing problems, and other strange behaviors:</p> <dl><dt>Yielding NIF</dt><dd> <p>If the functionality of a long-running NIF can be split so that
its work can be achieved through a series of shorter NIF calls,
the application has two options:</p> <ul><li> <p>Make that series of NIF calls from the Erlang level.</p> </li><li> <p>Call a NIF that first performs a chunk of the work, then
invokes the <a href="#enif_schedule_nif">enif_schedule_nif</a> function to schedule
another NIF call to perform the next chunk. The final call
scheduled in this manner can then return the overall
result.</p> </li></ul> <p>Breaking up a long-running function in this manner enables the
VM to regain control between calls to the NIFs.</p> <p>This approach is always preferred over the other alternatives
described below. This both from a performance perspective and
a system characteristics perspective.</p> </dd><dt>Threaded NIF</dt><dd> <p>This is accomplished by dispatching the work to another thread
managed by the NIF library, return from the NIF, and wait for
the result. The thread can send the result back to the Erlang
process using <a href="#enif_send">enif_send</a>.
Information about thread primitives is provided below.</p> </dd><dt><a name="dirty_nifs"></a>Dirty NIF</dt><dd> <div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>Dirty NIF support is available only when the emulator is
configured with dirty scheduler support. As of ERTS version
9.0, dirty scheduler support is enabled by default on the
runtime system with SMP support. The Erlang runtime without
SMP support does <em>not</em> support dirty schedulers even
when the dirty scheduler support is explicitly enabled. To
check at runtime for the presence of dirty scheduler threads,
code can use the <a href="#enif_system_info">enif_system_info</a> API function.</p></div> <p>A NIF that cannot be split and cannot execute in a millisecond
or less is called a "dirty NIF", as it performs work that the
ordinary schedulers of the Erlang runtime system cannot handle cleanly.
Applications that make use of such functions must indicate to the
runtime that the functions are dirty so they can be handled 
specially. This is handled by executing dirty jobs on a separate
set of schedulers called dirty schedulers. A dirty NIF executing
on a dirty scheduler does not have the same duration restriction
as a normal NIF.
</p> <p>
It is important to classify the dirty job correct. An I/O bound
job should be classified as such, and a CPU bound job should be
classified as such. If you should classify CPU bound jobs
as I/O bound jobs, dirty I/O schedulers might starve ordinary
schedulers. I/O bound jobs are expected to either block waiting
for I/O, and/or spend a limited amount of time moving data.
</p> <p>
To schedule a dirty NIF for execution, the application has two options:</p> <ul><li> <p>Set the appropriate flags value for the dirty NIF in its
<a href="#ErlNifFunc">ErlNifFunc</a>
entry.</p> </li><li> <p>Call <a href="#enif_schedule_nif">enif_schedule_nif</a>, pass to it a pointer
to the dirty NIF to be executed, and indicate with argument
<strong>flags</strong> whether it expects the operation to be CPU-bound
or I/O-bound.</p> </li></ul> <p>A job that alternates between I/O bound and CPU bound can be
reclassified and rescheduled using <strong>enif_schedule_nif</strong> so
that it executes on the correct type of dirty scheduler at all
times. For more information see the documentation of the
<strong>erl(1)</strong> command line arguments
<a href="./erl#+SDcpu">erl#+SDcpu</a>,
and <a href="./erl#+SDio">erl#+SDio</a>.</p> <p>While a process executes a dirty NIF, some operations that
communicate with it can take a very long time to complete.
Suspend or garbage collection of a process executing a dirty
NIF cannot be done until the dirty NIF has returned. Thus, other
processes waiting for such operations to complete might
have to wait for a very long time. Blocking multi-scheduling, that
is, calling <a href="./erlang#system_flag_multi_scheduling">erlang#system_flag_multi_scheduling</a>, can
also take a very long time to complete. This is because all ongoing
dirty operations on all dirty schedulers must complete before
the block operation can complete.</p> <p>Many operations communicating with a process executing a
dirty NIF can, however, complete while it executes the
dirty NIF. For example, retrieving information about it through
<a href="./erlang#process_info/1">erlang#process_info/1</a>, setting its group leader,
register/unregister its name, and so on.</p> <p>Termination of a process executing a dirty NIF can only be
completed up to a certain point while it executes the dirty NIF.
All Erlang resources, such as its registered name and its ETS
tables, are released. All links and monitors are triggered. The
execution of the NIF is, however, <em>not</em> stopped. The NIF
can safely continue execution, allocate heap memory, and so on,

This is an opaque type and values of it can only by used either as
arguments to API functions or as return values from NIFs. All
<strong>ERL_NIF_TERM</strong>s belong to an environment
(<a href="#ErlNifEnv">ErlNifEnv</a>).
A term cannot be destructed individually, it is valid until its
environment is destructed.</p> </dd><dt><a name="ErlNifEnv"></a><strong>ErlNifEnv</strong></dt><dd> <p><strong>ErlNifEnv</strong> represents an environment that can host Erlang
terms. All terms in an environment are valid as long as the
environment is valid. <strong>ErlNifEnv</strong> is an opaque type; pointers to
it can only be passed on to API functions. Three types of environments
exist:</p> <dl><dt>Process bound environment</dt><dd> <p>Passed as the first argument to all NIFs. All function arguments
passed to a NIF belong to that environment. The return value from
a NIF must also be a term belonging to the same environment.</p> <p>A process bound environment contains transient information
about the calling Erlang process. The environment is only valid
in the thread where it was supplied as argument until the NIF
returns. It is thus useless and dangerous to store pointers to
process bound environments between NIF calls.</p> </dd><dt>Callback environment</dt><dd> <p>Passed as the first argument to all the non-NIF callback functions

<a href="#ErlNifResourceStop">ErlNifResourceStop</a>).
Works like a process bound environment but with a temporary
pseudo process that "terminates" when the callback has
returned. Terms may be created in this environment but they will
only be accessible during the callback.</p> </dd><dt>Process independent environment</dt><dd> <p>Created by calling <a href="#enif_alloc_env">enif_alloc_env</a>. This environment can be

The purpose of the resource objects is as a container of the event object

type (read or write), repeated calls to <strong>enif_select</strong> must be made

selected events. It must be used in a bitwise OR combination with
<strong>ERL_NIF_SELECT_READ</strong> and/or <strong>ERL_NIF_SELECT_WRITE</strong> to
indicate which type of event to cancel. Arguments <strong>pid</strong> and
<strong>ref</strong> are ignored when <strong>ERL_NIF_SELECT_CANCEL</strong> is specified.

notification may already have been sent.</p><p>Use <strong>ERL_NIF_SELECT_STOP</strong> as <strong>mode</strong> in order to safely
close an event object that has been passed to <strong>enif_select</strong>. The
<a href="#ErlNifResourceStop">ErlNifResourceStop</a> callback
of the resource <strong>obj</strong> will be called when it is safe to close
the event object. This safe way of closing event objects must be used
even if all notifications have been received (or cancelled) and no
further calls to <strong>enif_select</strong> have been made.
<strong>ERL_NIF_SELECT_STOP</strong> will first cancel any selected events
before it calls or schedules the <strong>stop</strong> callback. Arguments
<strong>pid</strong> and <strong>ref</strong> are ignored when <strong>ERL_NIF_SELECT_STOP</strong>
is specified.</p><p>The first call to <strong>enif_select</strong> for a specific OS <strong>event</strong> will establish
a relation between the event object and the containing resource. All subsequent calls
for an <strong>event</strong> must pass its containing resource as argument
<strong>obj</strong>. The relation is dissolved when <strong>enif_select</strong> has
been called with <strong>mode</strong> as <strong>ERL_NIF_SELECT_STOP</strong> and the
corresponding <strong>stop</strong> callback has returned. A resource can contain
several event objects but one event object can only be contained within

is present. On each host, there must be on Erlang node
with the <a href="./erl_boot_server">kernel/erl_boot_server</a>,
which handles the load requests.
<strong>Hosts</strong> is a list of IP addresses (hostnames
are not acceptable).</p> </dd><dt><strong>-setcookie Cookie</strong></dt><dd> <p>Specifies the cookie of the Erlang runtime system. This flag

versions of Windows). It allows Erlang
emulators to run as services on the Windows system, allowing embedded
systems to start without any user needing to log on. The
emulator started in this way can be manipulated through the
Windows services applet in a manner similar to other services.Notice that <strong>erlsrv</strong> is not a general service utility for Windows,
but designed for embedded Erlang systems.<strong>erlsrv</strong> also provides a command-line interface for registering,
changing, starting, and stopping services.To manipulate services, the logged on user is to have
administrator privileges on the machine. The Erlang machine
itself is (default) run as the local administrator. This can be
changed with the Services applet in Windows.The processes created by the service can, as opposed to normal
services, be "killed" with the task manager. Killing an emulator
that is started by a service triggers the "OnFail" action
specified for that service, which can be a reboot.The following parameters can be specified for each Erlang service:<dl><dt><strong>StopAction</strong></dt><dd> <p>Tells <strong>erlsrv</strong> how to stop
the Erlang emulator. Default is to kill it (Win32
TerminateProcess), but this action can specify any Erlang
shell command that will be executed in the emulator to make
it stop. The emulator is expected to stop within 30 seconds
after the command is issued in the shell. If the emulator is
not stopped, it reports a running state to the service
manager.</p> </dd><dt><strong>OnFail</strong></dt><dd> <p>Can be one of the following:</p> <dl><dt><strong>reboot</strong></dt><dd> <p>The Windows system is rebooted whenever the emulator stops
(a more simple form of watchdog). This can be useful for
less critical systems, otherwise use the heart functionality
to accomplish this.</p> </dd><dt><strong>restart</strong></dt><dd> <p>Makes the Erlang emulator be
restarted (with whatever parameters are registered for the
service at the occasion) when it stops. If the emulator
stops again within 10 seconds, it is not restarted to avoid
an infinite loop, which could hang the Windows system.</p> </dd><dt><strong>restart_always</strong></dt><dd> <p>Similar to <strong>restart</strong>, but does
not try to detect cyclic restarts; it is expected that
some other mechanism is present to avoid the problem.</p> </dd><dt><strong>ignore</strong> (the default)</dt><dd> <p>Reports the service as stopped to the service manager
whenever it fails; it must be manually restarted.</p> </dd></dl> <p>On a system where release handling is used,
this is always to be set to <strong>ignore</strong>. Use
<strong>heart</strong> to restart the service on failure
instead.</p> </dd><dt><strong>Machine</strong></dt><dd> <p>The location of the Erlang emulator.
The default is the <strong>erl.exe</strong> located in the same
directory as <strong>erlsrv.exe</strong>. Do not specify
<strong>werl.exe</strong> as this emulator, it will not work.</p> <p>If the system uses release handling, this is to be set to a
program similar to <strong>start_erl.exe</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>Env</strong></dt><dd> <p>Specifies an <em>extra</em> environment
for the emulator. The environment variables specified
here are added to the system-wide environment block that is
normally present when a service starts up. Variables present
in both the system-wide environment and in the service
environment specification will be set to the value specified
in the service.</p> </dd><dt><strong>WorkDir</strong></dt><dd> <p>The working directory for the Erlang emulator.
Must be on a local drive (no network drives are mounted when a
service starts). Default working directory for services is
<strong>%SystemDrive%%SystemPath%</strong>.
Debug log files will be placed in this directory.</p> </dd><dt><strong>Priority</strong></dt><dd> <p>The process priority of the emulator. Can be one of the
following:</p> <dl><dt><strong>realtime</strong></dt><dd> <p>Not recommended, as the machine will possibly be
inaccessible to interactive users.</p> </dd><dt><strong>high</strong></dt><dd> <p>Can be used if two Erlang nodes are to reside on one dedicated
system and one is to have precedence over the other.</p> </dd><dt><strong>low</strong></dt><dd> <p>Can be used if interactive performance is not to be affected
by the emulator process.</p> </dd><dt><strong>default</strong> (the default&gt;</dt><dd> </dd></dl> </dd><dt><strong>SName or Name</strong></dt><dd> <p>Specifies the short or long
node name of the Erlang emulator. The Erlang services are
always distributed. Default is to use the service name as
(short) nodename.</p> </dd><dt><strong>DebugType</strong></dt><dd> <p>Specifies that output from the Erlang shell is to be
sent to a "debug log". The log file is named
&lt;servicename&gt;<strong>.debug</strong> or
&lt;servicename&gt;<strong>.debug.</strong>&lt;N&gt;,
where &lt;N&gt; is an integer from 1 through 99.
The log file is placed in the working directory of the
service (as specified in <strong>WorkDir</strong>).</p> <p>Can be one of the following:</p> <dl><dt><strong>new</strong></dt><dd> <p>Uses a separate log file for every invocation of the service
(&lt;servicename&gt;<strong>.debug.</strong>&lt;N&gt;).</p> </dd><dt><strong>reuse</strong></dt><dd> <p>Reuses the same log file
(&lt;servicename&gt;<strong>.debug</strong>).</p> </dd><dt><strong>console</strong></dt><dd> <p>Opens an interactive Windows console window for the Erlang
shell of the service. Automatically disables the
<strong>StopAction</strong>. A service started with an
interactive console window does not survive logouts.
<strong>OnFail</strong> actions do not work with
debug consoles either.</p> </dd><dt><strong>none</strong> (the default)</dt><dd> <p>The output of the Erlang shell is discarded.</p> </dd></dl> <div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>The <strong>console</strong> option is <em>not</em> intended
for production. It is <em>only</em> a convenient way to debug
Erlang services during development.</p><p>The <strong>new</strong> and <strong>reuse</strong> options
might seem convenient in a production system, but consider that
the logs grow indefinitely during the system lifetime and cannot
be truncated, except if the service is restarted.</p><p>In short, the <strong>DebugType</strong> is
intended for debugging only. Logs during production are
better produced with the standard Erlang logging facilities.</p></div> </dd><dt><strong>Args</strong></dt><dd> <p>Passes extra arguments to the emulator startup program
<strong>erl.exe</strong> (or <strong>start_erl.exe</strong>).
Arguments that cannot be specified here are
<strong>-noinput</strong> (<strong>StopActions</strong> would not work),
<strong>-name</strong>, and <strong>-sname</strong> (they are
specified in any way). The most common use is for specifying cookies
and flags to be passed to <strong>init:boot()</strong>
(<strong>-s</strong>).</p> </dd><dt><strong>InternalServiceName</strong></dt><dd> <p>Specifies the Windows-internal service name (not the display name,
which is the one <strong>erlsrv</strong> uses to identify the service).</p> <p>This internal name cannot be changed, it is fixed even if the
service is renamed. <strong>erlsrv</strong> generates a unique internal name
when a service is created. It is recommended to keep to the default
if release handling is to be used for the application.</p> <p>The internal service name can be seen in the Windows service
manager if viewing <strong>Properties</strong> for an Erlang service.</p> </dd><dt><strong>Comment</strong></dt><dd> <p>A textual comment describing the service. Not mandatory, but shows
up as the service description in the Windows service manager.</p> </dd></dl><a name="001"></a>
The naming of the service in a system that
uses release handling must follow the convention
<em>NodeName</em>_<em>Release</em>, where <em>NodeName</em> is
the first part of the Erlang node name (up to, but not including
the "@") and <em>Release</em> is the current release of the
application.</p><h2>Functions</h2><h3>erlsrv {set | add} &lt;service-name&gt; [&lt;service options&gt;]</h3><p>Add or modify an Erlang service.</p><p>The <strong>set</strong> and <strong>add</strong> commands modifies or adds an Erlang
service, respectively. The simplest form of an <strong>add</strong> command is
without any options in which case all default values
(described above) apply. The service name is mandatory.</p><p>Every option can be specified without parameters, the
default value is then applied. Values to the options are
supplied <em>only</em> when the default is not to be used.
For example, <strong>erlsrv set myservice -prio -arg</strong>
sets the default priority and removes all arguments.</p><p>Service options:</p><dl><dt><strong>-st[opaction] [&lt;erlang shell command&gt;]</strong></dt><dd> <p>Defines the <strong>StopAction</strong>, the command given
to the Erlang shell when the service is stopped.
Default is none.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-on[fail] [{reboot | restart | restart_always}]</strong></dt><dd> <p>The action to take when the Erlang emulator
stops unexpectedly. Default is to ignore.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-m[achine] [&lt;erl-command&gt;]</strong></dt><dd> <p>The complete path to the Erlang emulator. Never use the
<strong>werl</strong> program for this. Defaults to the
<strong>erl.exe</strong> in the same directory as
<strong>erlsrv.exe</strong>. When release handling
is used, this is to be set to a program similar to
<strong>start_erl.exe</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-e[nv] [&lt;variable&gt;[=&lt;value&gt;]] ...</strong></dt><dd> <p>Edits the environment block for the service. Every
environment variable specified is added to the system
environment block. If a variable specified here has the same
name as a system-wide environment variable, the specified
value overrides the system-wide. Environment variables are
added to this list by specifying
&lt;variable&gt;=&lt;value&gt; and deleted from the list by
specifying &lt;variable&gt; alone. The environment block is
automatically sorted. Any number of <strong>-env</strong>
options can be specified in one command. Default is to use the
system environment block unmodified (except for two additions,
see section <a href="#002">Environment</a>
below).</p> </dd><dt><strong>-w[orkdir] [&lt;directory&gt;]</strong></dt><dd> <p>The initial working directory of the Erlang
emulator. Defaults to the system directory.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-p[riority] [{low|high|realtime}]</strong></dt><dd> <p>The priority of the Erlang emulator. Default to the
Windows default priority.</p> </dd><dt><strong>{-sn[ame] | -n[ame]} [&lt;node-name&gt;]</strong></dt><dd> <p>The node name of the Erlang machine. Distribution is mandatory.
Defaults to <strong>-sname &lt;service name&gt;</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-d[ebugtype] [{new|reuse|console}]</strong></dt><dd> <p>Specifies where shell output is to be sent.
Default is that shell output is discarded.
To be used only for debugging.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-ar[gs] [&lt;limited erl arguments&gt;]</strong></dt><dd> <p>Extra arguments to the Erlang emulator. Avoid
<strong>-noinput</strong>, <strong>-noshell</strong>, and
<strong>-sname</strong>/<strong>-name</strong>. Default is
no extra arguments. Remember that the services cookie file is not
necessarily the same as the interactive users. The service
runs as the local administrator. Specify all arguments
together in one string, use double quotes (") to specify an
argument string containing spaces, and use quoted quotes (\")
to specify a quote within the argument string if necessary.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-i[nternalservicename] [&lt;internal name&gt;]</strong></dt><dd> <p><em>Only</em> allowed for <strong>add</strong>. Specifies a
Windows-internal service name for the service, which by
default is set to something unique (prefixed with the
original service name) by <strong>erlsrv</strong> when adding a new
service. Specifying this is a purely cosmethic action and is
<em>not</em> recommended if release handling is to be
performed. The internal service name cannot be changed once
the service is created. The internal name is <em>not</em> to
be confused with the ordinary service name, which is the name
used to identify a service to <strong>erlsrv</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-c[omment] [&lt;short description&gt;]</strong></dt><dd> <p>Specifies a textual comment describing the
service. This comment shows up as the service description
in the Windows service manager.</p> </dd></dl><h3>erlsrv {start | start_disabled | stop | disable |
        enable} &lt;service-name&gt;</h3><p>Manipulate the current service status.</p><p>These commands are only added for convenience, the normal
way to manipulate the state of a service is through the
control panels services applet.</p><p>The <strong>start</strong> and
<strong>stop</strong> commands communicates
with the service manager for starting and stopping a
service. The commands wait until the service is
started or stopped. When disabling a service, it is not
stopped, the disabled state does not take effect until the
service is stopped. Enabling a service sets it in
automatic mode, which is started at boot. This command cannot
set the service to manual.</p><p>The <strong>start_disabled</strong> command operates on a service
regardless of if it is enabled/disabled or started/stopped. It
does this by first enabling it (regardless of if it is enabled
or not), then starting it (if not already started), and
then disabling it. The result is a disabled but started
service, regardless of its earlier state. This is useful for
starting services temporarily during a release upgrade. The
difference between using <strong>start_disabled</strong> and the
sequence <strong>enable</strong>, <strong>start</strong>, and <strong>disable</strong> is
that all other <strong>erlsrv</strong> commands are locked out during
the sequence of operations in <strong>start_disable</strong>, making the
operation atomic from an <strong>erlsrv</strong> user's point of view.</p><h3>erlsrv remove &lt;service-name&gt;</h3><p>Remove the service.</p><p>Removes the service completely with all its registered
options. It is stopped before it is removed.</p><h3>erlsrv list [&lt;service-name&gt;]</h3><p>List all Erlang services or all options for one service. </p><p>If no service name is specified, a brief listing of all Erlang
services is presented. If a service name is supplied, all options
for that service are presented.</p><h3>erlsrv help</h3><p>Display a brief help text.</p><p>Displays a brief help text.</p><h3>Environment</h3><p><a name="002"></a>
The environment of an Erlang machine started
as a service contains two special variables:</p><dl><dt><strong>ERLSRV_SERVICE_NAME</strong></dt><dd>The name of the service that started the machine.</dd><dt><strong>ERLSRV_EXECUTABLE</strong></dt><dd>The full path to the <strong>erlsrv.exe</strong>, which can be used to manipulate the service. This comes in handy when defining a heart command for your service.</dd></dl><p>A command file for restarting a service looks as follows:</p><pre><code class="">
@echo off
%ERLSRV_EXECUTABLE% stop %ERLSRV_SERVICE_NAME%
%ERLSRV_EXECUTABLE% start %ERLSRV_SERVICE_NAME%    </code></pre><p>This command file is then set as heart command.</p><p>The environment variables can also be used to detect that we
are running as a service and make port programs react correctly
to the control events generated on logout (see the next section).</p><h3>Port Programs</h3><p>When a program runs in
the service context, it must handle the control events that are
sent to every program in the system when the interactive user
logs off. This is done in different ways for programs running in
the console subsystem and programs running as window
applications. An application running in the console subsystem
(normal for port programs) uses the win32 function
<strong>SetConsoleCtrlHandler</strong> to register a control handler
that returns <strong>true</strong> in answer to the
<strong>CTRL_LOGOFF_EVENT</strong>
and <strong>CTRL_SHUTDOWN_EVENT</strong> events. Other applications
only forward <strong>WM_ENDSESSION</strong> and
<strong>WM_QUERYENDSESSION</strong> to the default window procedure.</p><p>A brief example in C of how to set the console control handler:</p><pre><code class="">
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
/* 
** A Console control handler that ignores the log off events,
** and lets the default handler take care of other events.
*/   
BOOL WINAPI service_aware_handler(DWORD ctrl){
    if(ctrl == CTRL_LOGOFF_EVENT)
        return TRUE;
    if(ctrl == CTRL_SHUTDOWN_EVENT)
        return TRUE;
    return FALSE;
}

void initialize_handler(void){
    char buffer[2];
    /* 
     * We assume we are running as a service if this  
     * environment variable is defined.
     */
    if(GetEnvironmentVariable("ERLSRV_SERVICE_NAME",buffer,
                              (DWORD) 2)){
        /*
        ** Actually set the control handler
        */
        SetConsoleCtrlHandler(&amp;service_aware_handler, TRUE);
    }
}    </code></pre><h3>Notes</h3><p>Although the options are described in a Unix-like format, the case of
the options or commands is not relevant, and both character "/" and "-"
can be used for options.</p><p>Notice that the program resides in the emulator's <strong>bin</strong>
directory, not in the <strong>bin</strong> directory directly under
the Erlang root. The reasons for this are the subtle problem of
upgrading the emulator on a running system, where a new version of
the runtime system should not need to overwrite existing (and probably
used) executables.</p><p>To manipulate the Erlang services easily, put
the <strong>&lt;erlang_root&gt;\erts-&lt;version&gt;\bin</strong> directory in
the path instead of <strong>&lt;erlang_root&gt;\bin</strong>. The
<strong>erlsrv</strong> program can be found from inside Erlang by using the
<strong>os:find_executable/1</strong> Erlang function.</p><p>For release handling to work, use <strong>start_erl</strong> as the
Erlang machine. As stated <a href="#001">above</a>,
the service name is significant.</p><h3>See Also</h3><p><a href="start_erl">start_erl</a>,

tracing system. The functions in this module are called whenever
a trace probe is triggered. Both the <strong>enabled</strong> and <strong>trace</strong>
functions are called in the context of the entity that triggered the

This means that the overhead by having the tracing enabled is
greatly effected by how much time is spent in these functions. So, do as

</p><p><strong>erts_alloc</strong> is an Erlang runtime system internal memory
allocator library. <strong>erts_alloc</strong> provides the Erlang
runtime system with a number of memory allocators.</p><h3>Allocators</h3><a name="allocators"></a><p>The following allocators are present:</p><dl><dt><strong>temp_alloc</strong></dt><dd>Allocator used for temporary allocations.</dd><dt><strong>eheap_alloc</strong></dt><dd>Allocator used for Erlang heap data, such as Erlang process heaps. </dd><dt><strong>binary_alloc</strong></dt><dd>Allocator used for Erlang binary data.</dd><dt><strong>ets_alloc</strong></dt><dd>Allocator used for <strong>ets</strong> data.</dd><dt><strong>driver_alloc</strong></dt><dd>Allocator used for driver data.</dd><dt><strong>literal_alloc</strong></dt><dd>Allocator used for constant terms in Erlang code.</dd><dt><strong>sl_alloc</strong></dt><dd>Allocator used for memory blocks that are expected to be short-lived.</dd><dt><strong>ll_alloc</strong></dt><dd>Allocator used for memory blocks that are expected to be long-lived, for example, Erlang code.</dd><dt><strong>fix_alloc</strong></dt><dd>A fast allocator used for some frequently used fixed size data types.</dd><dt><strong>exec_alloc</strong></dt><dd>Allocator used by the <a href="./HiPE_app">hipe/HiPE_app</a> application for native executable code.</dd><dt><strong>std_alloc</strong></dt><dd>Allocator used for most memory blocks not allocated through any of the other allocators described above.</dd><dt><strong>sys_alloc</strong></dt><dd>This is normally the default <strong>malloc</strong> implementation used on the specific OS.</dd><dt><strong>mseg_alloc</strong></dt><dd>A memory segment allocator. It is used by other allocators for allocating memory segments and is only available on systems that have the <strong>mmap</strong> system call. Memory segments that are deallocated are kept for a while in a segment cache before they are destroyed. When segments are allocated, cached segments are used if possible instead of creating new segments. This to reduce the number of system calls made.</dd></dl><p><strong>sys_alloc</strong>, <strong>literal_alloc</strong> and <strong>temp_alloc</strong> are always
enabled and cannot be disabled. <strong>exec_alloc</strong> is only available if it
is needed and cannot be disabled. <strong>mseg_alloc</strong> is always enabled if it is
available and an allocator that uses it is enabled. All other
allocators can be <a href="#M_e">enabled or disabled</a>.
By default all allocators are enabled.
When an allocator is disabled, <strong>sys_alloc</strong> is used instead of
the disabled allocator.</p><p>The main idea with the <strong>erts_alloc</strong> library is to separate
memory blocks that are used differently into different memory
areas, to achieve less memory fragmentation. By
putting less effort in finding a good fit for memory blocks that
are frequently allocated than for those less frequently
allocated, a performance gain can be achieved.</p><a name="alloc_util"></a><h3>The alloc_util Framework</h3><p>Internally a framework called <strong>alloc_util</strong> is used for
implementing allocators. <strong>sys_alloc</strong> and
<strong>mseg_alloc</strong> do not use this framework, so the
following does <em>not</em> apply to them.</p><p>An allocator manages multiple areas, called carriers, in which
memory blocks are placed. A carrier is either placed in a
separate memory segment (allocated through <strong>mseg_alloc</strong>), or in
the heap segment (allocated through <strong>sys_alloc</strong>).</p><ul><li> <p>Multiblock carriers are used for storage of several blocks.</p> </li><li> <p>Singleblock carriers are used for storage of one block.</p> </li><li> <p>Blocks that are larger than the value of the singleblock carrier
threshold (<a href="#M_sbct">M_sbct</a>) parameter
are placed in singleblock carriers.</p> </li><li> <p>Blocks that are smaller than the value of parameter <strong>sbct</strong>
are placed in multiblock carriers.</p></li></ul><p>Normally an allocator creates a "main multiblock
carrier". Main multiblock carriers are never deallocated. The
size of the main multiblock carrier is determined by the value of
parameter <a href="#M_mmbcs">M_mmbcs</a>.</p><p><a name="mseg_mbc_sizes"></a>Sizes of multiblock carriers
allocated through <strong>mseg_alloc</strong> are decided based on the
following parameters:</p><ul><li>The values of the largest multiblock carrier size (<a href="#M_lmbcs">M_lmbcs</a>)</li><li>The smallest multiblock carrier size (<a href="#M_smbcs">M_smbcs</a>)</li><li>The multiblock carrier growth stages (<a href="#M_mbcgs">M_mbcgs</a>)</li></ul><p>If <strong>nc</strong> is the current number of multiblock carriers (the main
multiblock carrier excluded) managed by an allocator, the size
of the next <strong>mseg_alloc</strong> multiblock carrier allocated by
this allocator is roughly
<strong>smbcs+nc*(lmbcs-smbcs)/mbcgs</strong> when
<strong>nc &lt;= mbcgs</strong>,
and <strong>lmbcs</strong> when <strong>nc &gt; mbcgs</strong>. If the value of
parameter <strong>sbct</strong> is larger than the value of parameter
<strong>lmbcs</strong>, the allocator may have to create
multiblock carriers that are larger than the value of
parameter <strong>lmbcs</strong>, though.
Singleblock carriers allocated through <strong>mseg_alloc</strong> are sized
to whole pages.</p><p>Sizes of carriers allocated through <strong>sys_alloc</strong> are
decided based on the value of the <strong>sys_alloc</strong> carrier size
(<a href="#Muycs">Muycs</a>) parameter. The size of
a carrier is the least number of multiples of the value of
parameter <strong>ycs</strong> satisfying the request.</p><p>Coalescing of free blocks are always performed immediately.
Boundary tags (headers and footers) in free blocks are used,
which makes the time complexity for coalescing constant.</p><p><a name="strategy"></a>The memory allocation strategy
used for multiblock carriers by an allocator can be
configured using parameter <a href="#M_as">M_as</a>.
The following strategies are available:</p><dl><dt>Best fit</dt><dd> <p>Strategy: Find the smallest block satisfying the
requested block size.</p> <p>Implementation: A balanced binary search tree is
used. The time complexity is proportional to log N, where
N is the number of sizes of free blocks.</p> </dd><dt>Address order best fit</dt><dd> <p>Strategy: Find the smallest block satisfying the
requested block size. If multiple blocks are found, choose
the one with the lowest address.</p> <p>Implementation: A balanced binary search tree is
used. The time complexity is proportional to log N, where
N is the number of free blocks.</p> </dd><dt>Address order first fit</dt><dd> <p>Strategy: Find the block with the lowest address satisfying the
requested block size.</p> <p>Implementation: A balanced binary search tree is
used. The time complexity is proportional to log N, where
N is the number of free blocks.</p> </dd><dt>Address order first fit carrier best fit</dt><dd> <p>Strategy: Find the <em>carrier</em> with the lowest address that
can satisfy the requested block size, then find a block within
that carrier using the "best fit" strategy.</p> <p>Implementation: Balanced binary search trees are
used. The time complexity is proportional to log N, where
N is the number of free blocks.</p> </dd><dt>Address order first fit carrier address order best fit</dt><dd> <p>Strategy: Find the <em>carrier</em> with the lowest address that
can satisfy the requested block size, then find a block within
that carrier using the "address order best fit" strategy.</p> <p>Implementation: Balanced binary search trees are

N is the number of free blocks.</p> </dd><dt>Age order first fit carrier address order first fit</dt><dd> <p>Strategy: Find the <em>oldest carrier</em> that
can satisfy the requested block size, then find a block within
that carrier using the "address order first fit" strategy.</p> <p>Implementation: A balanced binary search tree is
used. The time complexity is proportional to log N, where
N is the number of free blocks.</p> </dd><dt>Age order first fit carrier best fit</dt><dd> <p>Strategy: Find the <em>oldest carrier</em> that

N is the number of free blocks.</p> </dd><dt>Good fit</dt><dd> <p>Strategy: Try to find the best fit, but settle for the best fit
found during a limited search.</p> <p>Implementation: The implementation uses segregated free
lists with a maximum block search depth (in each list)
to find a good fit fast. When the maximum block
search depth is small (by default 3), this implementation
has a time complexity that is constant. The maximum block
search depth can be configured using parameter
<a href="#M_mbsd">M_mbsd</a>.</p> </dd><dt>A fit</dt><dd> <p>Strategy: Do not search for a fit, inspect only one free
block to see if it satisfies the request. This strategy is
only intended to be used for temporary allocations.</p> <p>Implementation: Inspect the first block in a free-list.
If it satisfies the request, it is used, otherwise a new
carrier is created. The implementation has a time
complexity that is constant.</p> <p>As from ERTS 5.6.1 the emulator refuses to
use this strategy on other allocators than <strong>temp_alloc</strong>.
This because it only causes problems for other allocators.</p> </dd></dl><p>Apart from the ordinary allocators described above, some
pre-allocators are used for some specific data types. These
pre-allocators pre-allocate a fixed amount of memory for certain data

without having to compile them first, and an easy way to retrieve the
command-line arguments.It is possible to bundle <strong>escript</strong>(s) with an Erlang
runtime system to make it self-sufficient and relocatable. In such
a standalone system, the <strong>escript</strong>(s) should be located in
the top <strong>bin</strong> directory of the standalone system and given
<strong>.escript</strong> as file extension. Further the (built-in)
<strong>escript</strong> program should be copied to the same directory and
given the scripts original name (without the <strong>.escript</strong>
extension). This will enable use of the bundled Erlang runtime
system.The (built-in) <strong>escript</strong> program first determines which
Erlang runtime system to use and then starts it to execute your
script. Usually the runtime system is located in the same Erlang
installation as the <strong>escript</strong> program itself. But for
standalone systems with one or more escripts it may be the case
that the <strong>escript</strong> program in your path actually starts the
runtime system bundled with the escript. This is intentional, and
typically happens when the standalone system <strong>bin</strong> directory is not
in the execution path (as it may cause its <strong>erl</strong> program to
override the desired one) and the <strong>escript</strong>(s) are referred to via
symbolic links from a <strong>bin</strong> directory in the path.</p><h2>Functions</h2><h3>script-name script-arg1 script-arg2...</h3><h3>escript escript-flags script-name script-arg1 script-arg2...</h3><p>Run a script written in Erlang.</p><p><strong>escript</strong> runs a script written in Erlang.</p><p>Example:</p><pre>

<a href="./epp">stdlib/epp</a> preprocessor.
This means that you, for example, can use predefined macros
(such as <strong>?MODULE</strong>) and include directives like
the <strong>-include_lib</strong> directive. For example, use</p><pre>
-include_lib("kernel/include/file.hrl").</pre><p>to include the record definitions for the records used by function
<a href="../kernel/file#read_link_info/1">kernel/file#read_link_info/1</a>. You can also select
encoding by including an encoding comment here, but if
a valid encoding comment exists on the second line, it takes
precedence.</p><p>The script is checked for syntactic and semantic
correctness before it is run. If there are warnings (such as
unused variables), they are printed and the script will
still be run. If there are errors, they are printed and
the script will not be run and its exit status is
<strong>127</strong>.</p><p>Both the module declaration and the export declaration of
the <strong>main/1</strong> function are optional.</p><p>By default, the script will be interpreted. You can force
it to be compiled by including the following line somewhere
in the script file:</p><pre>
-mode(compile).</pre><p>Execution of interpreted code is slower than compiled code.
If much of the execution takes place in interpreted code, it
can be worthwhile to compile it, although the compilation
itself takes a little while. Also, <strong>native</strong> can be supplied
instead of <strong>compile</strong>. This compiles the script
using the native flag and may or may not be worthwhile
depending on the escript characteristics.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, a script can
contains precompiled <strong>beam</strong> code. In a precompiled
script, the interpretation of the script header is
the same as in a script containing source code. This means
that you can make a <strong>beam</strong> file executable by
prepending the file with the lines starting with <strong>#!</strong>
and <strong>%%!</strong> mentioned above. In a precompiled script, the
<strong>main/1</strong> function must be exported.</p><p>Another option is to have an entire
Erlang archive in the script. In an archive script, the
interpretation of the script header is the same as
in a script containing source code. This means that you can
make an archive file executable by prepending the file with
the lines starting with <strong>#!</strong> and <strong>%%!</strong> mentioned
above. In an archive script, the <strong>main/1</strong> function must
be exported. By default the <strong>main/1</strong> function in the
module with the same name as the basename of the
<strong>escript</strong> file is invoked. This behavior can be
overridden by setting flag <strong>-escript main Module</strong>
as one of the emulator flags. <strong>Module</strong> must be the
name of a module that has an exported <strong>main/1</strong>
function. For more information about archives and code loading, see
<a href="./code">kernel/code</a>.</p><p>It is often very convenient to have a header in
the escript, especially on Unix platforms. However, the header
is optional, so you directly can "execute"
an Erlang module, Beam file, or archive file without adding
any header to them. But then you have to invoke the script
as follows:</p><pre>

Creates an escript from a list of sections. The
sections can be specified in any order. An escript begins with an
optional <strong>Header</strong> followed by a mandatory <strong>Body</strong>. If
the header is present, it does always begin with a
<strong>shebang</strong>, possibly followed by a <strong>comment</strong> and
<strong>emu_args</strong>. The <strong>shebang</strong> defaults to
<strong>"/usr/bin/env escript"</strong>. The <strong>comment</strong> defaults to
<strong>"This is an -*- erlang -*- file"</strong>. The created escript
can either be returned as a binary or written to file.</p><p>As an example of how the function can be used, we create an

but with the difference that <strong>persistent_term</strong> has been
highly optimized for reading terms at the expense of writing and
updating terms. When a persistent term is updated or deleted, a
global garbage collection pass is run to scan all processes for
the deleted term, and to copy it into each process that still uses
it. Therefore, <strong>persistent_term</strong> is suitable for storing
Erlang terms that are frequently accessed but never or
infrequently updated.Term lookup (using <a href="#get/1">get/1</a>), is done in constant time
and without taking any locks, and the term is <span class="strong">not</span>
copied to the heap (as is the case with terms stored in ETS
tables).Storing or updating a term (using <a href="#put/2">put/2</a>) is proportional to the
number of already created persistent terms because the hash table
holding the keys will be copied. In addition, the term itself will
be copied.When a (complex) term is deleted (using <a href="#erase/1">erase/1</a>) or replaced by another
(using <a href="#put/2">put/2</a>), a global
garbage collection is initiated. It works like this:<ul><li><p>All processes in the system will be scheduled to run a
scan of their heaps for the term that has been deleted.  While
such scan is relatively light-weight, if there are many
processes, the system can become less responsive until all
process have scanned their heaps.</p></li><li><p>If the deleted term (or any part of it) is still used
by a process, that process will do a major (fullsweep) garbage
collection and copy the term into the process. However, at most
two processes at a time will be scheduled to do that kind of
garbage collection.</p></li></ul>Deletion of atoms and other terms that fit in one machine word
is specially optimized to avoid doing a global GC. It is still not
recommended to update persistent terms with such values too
frequently because the hash table holding the keys is copied every
time a persistent term is updated.Some examples are suitable uses for persistent terms are:<ul><li><p>Storing of configuration data that must be easily
accessible by all processes.</p></li><li><p>Storing of references for NIF resources.</p></li><li><p>Storing of references for efficient counters.</p></li><li><p>Storing an atom to indicate a logging level or whether debugging
is turned on.</p></li></ul></p><h3>Storing Huge Persistent Terms</h3><p>The current implementation of persistent terms uses the literal
<a href="erts_alloc">allocator</a> also used for
literals (constant terms) in BEAM code.  By default, 1 GB of
virtual address space is reserved for literals in BEAM code and
persistent terms. The amount of virtual address space reserved for
literals can be changed by using the <a href="./erts_alloc#MIscs">erts_alloc#MIscs</a> when
starting the emulator.</p><p>Here is an example how the reserved virtual address space for literals
can be raised to 2 GB (2048 MB):</p><pre>
    erl +MIscs 2048</pre><h3>Best Practices for Using Persistent Terms</h3><p>It is recommended to use keys like <strong>?MODULE</strong> or
<strong>{?MODULE,SubKey}</strong> to avoid name collisions.</p><p>Prefer creating a few large persistent terms to creating many
small persistent terms. The execution time for storing a
persistent term is proportional to the number of already existing
terms.</p><p>Updating a persistent term with the same value as it already
has is specially optimized to do nothing quickly; thus, there is
no need compare the old and new values and avoid calling
<a href="#put/2">put/2</a> if the values
are equal.</p><p>When atoms or other terms that fit in one machine word are
deleted, no global GC is needed. Therefore, persistent terms that
have atoms as their values can be updated more frequently, but
note that updating such persistent terms is still much more
expensive than reading them.</p><p>Updating or deleting a persistent term will trigger a global GC
if the term does not fit in one machine word. Processes will be
scheduled as usual, but all processes will be made runnable at
once, which will make the system less responsive until all process
have run and scanned their heaps for the deleted terms. One way to
minimize the effects on responsiveness could be to minimize the
number of processes on the node before updating or deleting a
persistent term. It would also be wise to avoid updating terms
when the system is at peak load.</p><p>Avoid storing a retrieved persistent term in a process if that
persistent term could be deleted or updated in the future. If a
process holds a reference to a persistent term when the term is
deleted, the process will be garbage collected and the term copied
to process.</p><p>Avoid updating or deleting more than one persistent term at a
time.  Each deleted term will trigger its own global GC. That
means that deleting N terms will make the system less responsive N
times longer than deleting a single persistent term. Therefore,
terms that are to be updated at the same time should be collected
into a larger term, for example, a map or a tuple.</p><h3>Example</h3><p>The following example shows how lock contention for ETS tables
can be minimized by having one ETS table for each scheduler. The
table identifiers for the ETS tables are stored as a single
persistent term:</p><pre>
    %% There is one ETS table for each scheduler.
    Sid = erlang:system_info(scheduler_id),
    Tid = element(Sid, persistent_term:get(?MODULE)),
    ets:update_counter(Tid, Key, 1).</pre><h2>Data Types</h2><span class="name">key</span><p>Any Erlang term.</p><span class="name">value</span><p>Any Erlang term.</p><h2>Functions</h2><h3>erase/1</h3><p>Erase the name for a persistent term.</p><p>Erase the name for the persistent term with key

This program redirects the standard input and standard
output streams so that all output can be logged. It also lets the
program <strong>to_erl</strong> connect to the Erlang console, making
it possible to monitor and debug an embedded system remotely.For more information about the use, see the
<a href="./embedded_solaris"> Embedded System User's Guide</a> in System Documentation.</p><h2>Functions</h2><h3>run_erl [-daemon] pipe_dir/ log_dir "exec command
        arg1 arg2 ..."</h3><p>Start the Erlang emulator without attached terminal.</p><p>Arguments:</p><dl><dt><strong>-daemon</strong></dt><dd> <p>This option is highly recommended. It makes <strong>run_erl</strong> run
in the background completely detached from any controlling
terminal and the command returns to the caller immediately.
Without this option, <strong>run_erl</strong> must be started using several
tricks in the shell to detach it completely from the
terminal in use when starting it. The option must be the
first argument to <strong>run_erl</strong> on the command line.</p> </dd><dt><strong>pipe_dir</strong></dt><dd> <p>The named pipe, usually <strong>/tmp/</strong>. It must be
suffixed by a <strong>/</strong> (slash), that is,
<strong>/tmp/epipes/</strong>, not
<strong>/tmp/epipes</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>log_dir</strong></dt><dd> <p>The log files, that is:</p> <ul><li> <p>One log file, <strong>run_erl.log</strong>, which logs
progress and warnings from the <strong>run_erl</strong>
program itself.</p> </li><li> <p>Up to five log files at maximum 100 KB each with the content
of the standard streams from and to the command. (Both the
number of logs and sizes can be changed by environment
variables, see section <a href="#environment_variables">Environment Variables</a>
below.)</p> <p>When the logs are full, <strong>run_erl</strong> deletes
and reuses the oldest log file.</p> </li></ul> </dd><dt><strong>"exec command arg1 arg2 ..."</strong></dt><dd> <p>A space-separated string specifying the program to be executed.
The second field is typically a command name such as <strong>erl</strong>.</p> </dd></dl><h3>Notes concerning the Log Files</h3><p>While running, <strong>run_erl</strong> sends all output,
uninterpreted, to a log file. The file is named
<strong>erlang.log.N</strong>, where <strong>N</strong> is an integer. When the
log is "full" (default log size is 100 KB), <strong>run_erl</strong> starts to log
in file <strong>erlang.log.(N+1)</strong>, until <strong>N</strong> reaches a
certain number (default 5), whereupon <strong>N</strong> starts at 1 again and
the oldest files start getting overwritten.</p><p>If no output comes from the Erlang shell, but
the Erlang machine still seems to be alive, an "ALIVE" message is
written to the log; it is a time stamp and is written, by default,
after 15 minutes of inactivity. Also, if output from Erlang is
logged, but more than 5 minutes (default) has passed since last time
we got anything from Erlang, a time stamp is written in the
log. The "ALIVE" messages look as follows:</p><pre><code class="">
===== ALIVE &lt;date-time-string&gt;    </code></pre><p>The other time stamps look as follows:</p><pre><code class="">
===== &lt;date-time-string&gt;    </code></pre><p><strong>date-time-string</strong> is the date and time the message is
written, default in local time (can be changed to UTC if needed).
It is formatted with the ANSI-C function <strong>strftime</strong>
using the format string <strong>%a %b %e %T %Z %Y</strong>, which
produces messages like
<strong>===== ALIVE Thu May 15 10:13:36 MEST 2003</strong>; this can
be changed, see the next section.</p><a name="environment_variables"></a><h3>Environment Variables</h3><p>The following environment variables are recognized by <strong>run_erl</strong>
and change the logging behavior. For more information, see the previous
section.</p><dl><dt><strong>RUN_ERL_LOG_ALIVE_MINUTES</strong></dt><dd> <p>How long to wait for output (in minutes) before writing an
"ALIVE" message to the log. Defaults to 15, minimum is 1.</p> </dd><dt><strong>RUN_ERL_LOG_ACTIVITY_MINUTES</strong></dt><dd> <p>How long Erlang needs to be inactive before output is
preceded with a time stamp. Defaults to
<strong>RUN_ERL_LOG_ALIVE_MINUTES div 3</strong>, minimum is 1.</p> </dd><dt><strong>RUN_ERL_LOG_ALIVE_FORMAT</strong></dt><dd> <p>Specifies another format string to be used in the <strong>strftime</strong>
C library call. That is, specifying this to
<strong>"%e-%b-%Y, %T %Z"</strong> gives
log messages with time stamps like
<strong>15-May-2003, 10:23:04 MET</strong>. For more information,
see the documentation for the C library function <strong>strftime</strong>.
Defaults to <strong>"%a %b %e %T %Z %Y"</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>RUN_ERL_LOG_ALIVE_IN_UTC</strong></dt><dd> <p>If set to anything else than <strong>0</strong>, it makes all
times displayed by <strong>run_erl</strong> to be in UTC (GMT, CET, MET,
without Daylight Saving Time), rather than in local time.
This does not affect data coming from Erlang,
only the logs output directly by <strong>run_erl</strong>. Application
SASL can be modified accordingly by setting the Erlang
application variable <strong>utc_log</strong> to
<strong>true</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>RUN_ERL_LOG_GENERATIONS</strong></dt><dd> <p>Controls the number of log files written before older
files are reused. Defaults to 5, minimum is 2, maximum is 1000.</p> <p>Note that, as a way to indicate the newest file, <strong>run_erl</strong> will
delete the oldest log file to maintain a "hole" in the file
sequences. For example, if log files #1, #2, #4 and #5 exists, that
means #2 is the latest and #4 is the oldest. You will therefore at most
get one less log file than the value set by
<strong>RUN_ERL_LOG_GENERATIONS</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>RUN_ERL_LOG_MAXSIZE</strong></dt><dd> <p>The size, in bytes, of a log file before switching to a
new log file. Defaults to 100000, minimum is 1000, maximum is
about 2^30.</p> </dd><dt><strong>RUN_ERL_DISABLE_FLOWCNTRL</strong></dt><dd> <p>If defined, disables input and output flow control for the pty
opend by <strong>run_erl</strong>. Useful if you want to remove any risk of
accidentally blocking the flow control by using Ctrl-S (instead of
Ctrl-D to detach), which can result in blocking of the entire Beam
process, and in the case of running heart as supervisor even the
heart process becomes blocked when writing log message to terminal,
leaving the heart process unable to do its work.</p> </dd></dl><h3>See Also</h3><p><a href="start">start</a>,

Windows NT/2000/XP (and later versions of Windows).
Although there are programs with the same name on other
platforms, their functionality is different.This program is distributed both in compiled
form (under &lt;Erlang root&gt;\\erts-&lt;version&gt;\\bin) and
in source form (under &lt;Erlang root&gt;\\erts-&lt;version&gt;\\src).
The purpose of the source code is to ease customization of the
program for local needs, such as cyclic restart
detection. There is also a "make"-file, written for the
<strong>nmake</strong> program distributed with Microsoft Visual
C++. This program can, however, be compiled with
any Win32 C compiler (possibly with minor modifications).This program aids release handling on Windows systems.
The program is to be called by the
<strong>erlsrv</strong> program, read up the release data file
<strong>start_erl.data</strong>, and start Erlang. Some options to
<strong>start_erl</strong> are added and removed by the release handler
during upgrade with emulator restart (more specifically option
<strong>-data</strong>).</p><h2>Functions</h2><h3>start_erl [&lt;erl options&gt;] ++ [&lt;start_erl options&gt;]</h3><p>Start the Erlang emulator with the correct release data. </p><p>The <strong>start_erl</strong> program in its original form
recognizes the following options:</p><dl><dt><strong>++</strong></dt><dd> <p>Mandatory. Delimits <strong>start_erl</strong> options from normal Erlang
options. Everything on the command line <em>before</em>
<strong>++</strong> is interpreted as options to be sent to the
<strong>erl</strong> program. Everything <em>after</em>
<strong>++</strong> is interpreted as options to
<strong>start_erl</strong> itself.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-reldir &lt;release root&gt;</strong></dt><dd> <p>Mandatory if environment variable
<strong>RELDIR</strong> is not specified and no
<strong>-rootdir</strong> option is specified. Tells <strong>start_erl</strong> where
the root of the release tree is located in the file system
(typically &lt;Erlang root&gt;\\releases). The
<strong>start_erl.data</strong> file is expected to be
located in this directory (unless otherwise specified). If
only option <strong>-rootdir</strong> is specified, the directory is
assumed to be &lt;Erlang root&gt;\\releases.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-rootdir &lt;Erlang root directory&gt;</strong></dt><dd> <p>Mandatory if <strong>-reldir</strong> is not specified and no
<strong>RELDIR</strong> exists in the environment. This
specifies the Erlang installation root directory (under
which the <strong>lib</strong>, <strong>releases</strong>, and
<strong>erts-&lt;Version&gt;</strong> directories are located). If only
<strong>-reldir</strong> (or environment variable <strong>RELDIR</strong>)
is specified, the Erlang root is assumed to
be the directory exactly one level above the release
directory.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-data &lt;data file name&gt;</strong></dt><dd> <p>Optional. Specifies another data file than <strong>start_erl.data</strong>
in the &lt;release root&gt;. It is specified relative to the
&lt;release root&gt; or absolute (including drive letter, and so
on). This option is used by the release handler during
upgrade and is not to be used during normal
operation. Normally the release data file is not to be
named differently.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-bootflags &lt;boot flags file name&gt;</strong></dt><dd> <p>Optional. Specifies a file name relative to the release
directory (that is, the subdirectory of &lt;release root&gt;
where the <strong>.boot</strong> file and others are located).
The contents of this file is appended to the command line
when Erlang is started. This makes it easy to start the
emulator with different options for different releases.</p> </dd></dl><h3>Notes</h3><ul><li> <p>As the source code is distributed, it can easily be modified to
accept other options. The program must still accept option
<strong>-data</strong> with the semantics described above for the
release handler to work correctly.</p> </li><li> <p>The Erlang emulator is found by examining the registry keys for
the emulator version specified in the release data file. The new
emulator must be properly installed before the upgrade for
this to work.</p> </li><li> <p>Although the program is located together with files specific to the
emulator version, it is not expected to be specific to the
emulator version. The release handler does <em>not</em> change option
<strong>-machine</strong> to <strong>erlsrv</strong> during
emulator restart. Locate the (possibly customized)
<strong>start_erl</strong> program so that it is not overwritten
during upgrade.</p> </li><li> <p>The default options of the <strong>erlsrv</strong> program are not
sufficient for release handling. The machine started by
<strong>erlsrv</strong> is be specified as the
<strong>start_erl</strong> program and the arguments are to contain
<strong>++</strong> followed by the desired options.</p> </li></ul><h3>See Also</h3><p><a href="erlsrv">erlsrv</a>,
<a href="./release_handler">sasl/release_handler</a></p><h2>werl</h2><p>The Erlang Emulator</p><p>On Windows, the preferred way to start the Erlang system for interactive
use is as follows:<strong>werl &lt;arguments&gt;</strong>This starts Erlang in its own window, with fully
functioning command-line editing and scrollbars. All flags
except <strong>-oldshell</strong> work as they do for
<a href="erl">erl</a>.<ul><li> <p>To copy text to the clipboard, use <strong>Ctrl-C</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p>To paste text, use <strong>Ctrl-V</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p>To interrupt the runtime system or the shell process (depending
on what has been specified with system flag <strong>+B</strong>), use
<strong>Ctrl-Break</strong>.</p> </li></ul>In cases where you want to redirect standard input and/or
standard output or use Erlang in a pipeline, <strong>werl</strong> is
not suitable, and the <strong>erl</strong> program is to be used instead.The <strong>werl</strong> window is in many ways modeled after the <strong>xterm</strong>
window present on other platforms, as the <strong>xterm</strong> model
fits well with line-oriented command-based interaction. This
means that selecting text is line-oriented rather than
rectangle-oriented.<ul><li> <p>To select text in the <strong>werl</strong> window, press and hold
the left mouse button and drag the mouse over the text you want
to select. If the selection crosses line boundaries, the
selected text consists of complete lines where applicable
(just like in a word processor).</p> </li><li> <p>To select more text than fits
in the window, start by selecting a small part in the
beginning of the text you want, then use the scrollbar
to view the end of the desired selection, point to it, and press
the <em>right</em> mouse button. The whole area between your
first selection and the point where you right-clicked is
included in the selection.</p> </li><li> <p>To copy the selected text to the clipboard, either
use <strong>Ctrl-C</strong>, use the menu, or press the copy
button in the toolbar.</p> </li></ul>Pasted text is inserted at the current prompt position
and is interpreted by Erlang as usual keyboard input.<ul><li> <p>To retrieve previous command lines, press the <strong>Up arrow</strong> or
use <strong>Ctrl-P</strong>.</p> </li></ul>A drop-down box in the toolbar contains the command
history. Selecting a command in the drop-down box inserts the command
at the prompt, as if you used the keyboard to retrieve the
command.<ul><li> <p>To stop the Erlang emulator, close the <strong>werl</strong> window.</p> </li></ul></p><h2>zlib</h2><p>zlib compression interface.</p><p>This module provides an API for the zlib library
(<a href="http://www.zlib.net">www.zlib.net</a>).
It is used to compress and decompress data.
The data format is described by
<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1950.txt">RFC 1950</a>,
<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt">RFC 1951</a>, and
<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1952.txt">RFC 1952</a>.A typical (compress) usage is as follows:<pre>
Z = zlib:open(),
ok = zlib:deflateInit(Z,default),

Compress = fun(end_of_data, _Cont) -&gt; [];
              (Data, Cont) -&gt;
                 [zlib:deflate(Z, Data)|Cont(Read(),Cont)]
           end,
Compressed = Compress(Read(),Compress),
Last = zlib:deflate(Z, [], finish),
ok = zlib:deflateEnd(Z),
zlib:close(Z),
list_to_binary([Compressed|Last])</pre>In all functions errors, <strong>{'EXIT',{Reason,Backtrace}}</strong>,
can be thrown, where <strong>Reason</strong> describes the error.Typical <strong>Reasons</strong>s:<dl><dt><strong>badarg</strong></dt><dd>Bad argument. </dd><dt><strong>not_initialized</strong></dt><dd>The stream hasn't been initialized, eg. if <a href="#inflateInit/1">inflateInit/1</a> wasn't called prior to a call to <a href="#inflate/2">inflate/2</a>. </dd><dt><strong>not_on_controlling_process</strong></dt><dd>The stream was used by a process that doesn't control it.

random distribution. In this case, the compression algorithm is
tuned to compress them better. The effect of <strong>filtered</strong> is to
force more Huffman coding and less string matching; it is somewhat
intermediate between <strong>default</strong> and <strong>huffman_only</strong>.
<strong>rle</strong> is designed to be almost as fast as

This can be
used to switch between compression and straight copy of the

by the stream. This function must be called between
<a href="#inflateInit/1">inflateInit/1</a>
and <a href="#inflateEnd/1">inflateEnd/1</a>.</p><p>Only supported if ERTS was compiled with zlib &gt;= 1.2.8.</p><h3>inflateInit/1</h3><p>Initialize a session for decompression.</p><p>Initializes a zlib stream for decompression.</p><h3>inflateInit/2</h3><p>Initialize a session for decompression.</p><p>Initializes a decompression session on zlib stream.</p><p><strong><span class="anno">WindowBits</span></strong> is the base two logarithm
of the maximum window size (the size of the history buffer).
It is to be in the range 8 through 15. Default to 15 if
<a href="#inflateInit/1">inflateInit/1</a>
is used.</p><p>If a compressed stream with a larger window size is specified as
input, <a href="#inflate/2">inflate/2</a>
throws the <strong>data_error</strong> exception.</p><p>A negative <strong><span class="anno">WindowBits</span></strong> value makes zlib
ignore the zlib header (and checksum) from the stream. Notice that
the zlib source mentions this only as a undocumented feature.</p><h3>inflateReset/1</h3><p>&gt;Reset the inflate session.</p><p>Equivalent to
<a href="#inflateEnd/1">inflateEnd/1</a>
followed by
<a href="#inflateInit/1">inflateInit/1</a>,
but does not free and reallocate all the internal decompression state.
The stream will keep attributes that could have been set by
<strong>inflateInit/1,2</strong>.</p><h3>inflateSetDictionary/2</h3><p>Initialize the decompression dictionary.</p><p>Initializes the decompression dictionary from the specified
uncompressed byte sequence. This function must be called as a
response to an inflate operation (eg.
<a href="#safeInflate/2">safeInflate/2</a>)
returning <strong>{need_dictionary,Adler,Output}</strong> or in the case of
deprecated functions, throwing an
<strong>{'EXIT',{{need_dictionary,Adler},_StackTrace}}</strong> exception.</p><p>The dictionary chosen by the compressor can be determined from the
Adler value returned or thrown by the call to the inflate function.
The compressor and decompressor must use the same dictionary (See
<a href="#deflateSetDictionary/2">deflateSetDictionary/2</a>).</p><p>After setting the dictionary the inflate operation should be
retried without new input.</p><p>Example:</p><pre>
deprecated_unpack(Z, Compressed, Dict) -&gt;
     case catch zlib:inflate(Z, Compressed) of
          {'EXIT',{{need_dictionary,_DictID},_}} -&gt;
                 ok = zlib:inflateSetDictionary(Z, Dict),
                 Uncompressed = zlib:inflate(Z, []);
          Uncompressed -&gt;
                 Uncompressed
     end.

new_unpack(Z, Compressed, Dict) -&gt;
    case zlib:inflate(Z, Compressed, [{exception_on_need_dict, false}]) of
        {need_dictionary, _DictId, Output} -&gt;
            ok = zlib:inflateSetDictionary(Z, Dict),
            [Output | zlib:inflate(Z, [])];
        Uncompressed -&gt;
            Uncompressed
    end.</pre><h3>open/0</h3><p>Open a stream and return a stream reference.</p><p>Opens a zlib stream.</p><h3>safeInflate/2</h3><p>Decompress data with limited output size.</p><p>Like <a href="#inflate/2">inflate/2</a>,
but returns once it has expanded beyond a small 
implementation-defined threshold. It's useful when decompressing
untrusted input which could have been maliciously crafted to expand
until the system runs out of memory.</p><p>This function returns <strong>{continue | finished, Output}</strong>, where
<span class="anno">Output</span> is the data that was decompressed in this call.
New input can be queued up on each call if desired, and the function
will return <strong>{finished, Output}</strong> once all queued data has been
decompressed.</p><p>This function can introduce some output latency (reading
input without producing any output).</p><p>If a preset dictionary is required for further decompression, this
function returns a <strong>need_dictionary</strong> tuple. See
<a href="#inflateSetDictionary/2">inflateSetDictionary/2</a>) for details.</p><p>Example:</p><pre>
walk(Compressed, Handler) -&gt;
    Z = zlib:open(),
    zlib:inflateInit(Z),
    loop(Z, Handler, zlib:safeInflate(Z, Compressed)),
    zlib:inflateEnd(Z),
    zlib:close(Z).

loop(Z, Handler, {continue, Output}) -&gt;
    Handler(Output),
    loop(Z, Handler, zlib:safeInflate(Z, []));
loop(Z, Handler, {finished, Output}) -&gt;
    Handler(Output).</pre><h3>setBufSize/2</h3><p>Set buffer size.</p><p>Sets the intermediate buffer size.</p><div class="alert alert-warning"><h4 class="alert-heading">Warning</h4><p>This function is deprecated and will be removed in a future
release.</p></div><h3>set_controlling_process/2</h3><p>Transfers ownership of a zlib stream.</p><p>Changes the controlling process of <strong><span class="anno">Z</span></strong> to
<strong><span class="anno">Pid</span></strong>, which must be a local process.</p><h3>uncompress/1</h3><p>Uncompress data with standard zlib functionality.</p><p>Uncompresses data with zlib headers and checksum.</p><h3>unzip/1</h3><p>Uncompress data without the zlib headers.</p><p>Uncompresses data without zlib headers and checksum.</p><h3>zip/1</h3><p>Compress data without the zlib headers.</p><p>Compresses data without zlib headers and checksum.</p></body></html>
