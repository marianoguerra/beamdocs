has been changed with larger types for the callbacks
<a href="#output">output</a>,
<a href="#control">control</a>, and
<a href="#call">call</a>.
See driver <a href="./erl_driver#version_management"> version management</a> in
<a href="erl_driver">erl_driver</a>.The <strong>driver_entry</strong> structure is a C struct that all Erlang
drivers define. It contains entry points for the Erlang driver,
which are called by the Erlang emulator when Erlang code accesses
the driver.<a name="emulator"></a>
The <a href="erl_driver">erl_driver</a> driver
API functions need a port handle
that identifies the driver instance (and the port in the
emulator). This is only passed to the <strong>start</strong> function, but
not to the other functions. The <strong>start</strong> function returns a
driver-defined handle that is passed to the other functions. A
common practice is to have the <strong>start</strong> function allocate
some application-defined structure and stash the <strong>port</strong>
handle in it, to use it later with the driver API functions.The driver callback functions are called synchronously from the
Erlang emulator. If they take too long before completing, they
can cause time-outs in the emulator. Use the queue or
asynchronous calls if necessary, as the emulator must be
responsive.The driver structure contains the driver name and some
15 function pointers, which are called at different
times by the emulator.The only exported function from the driver is
<strong>driver_init</strong>. This function returns the <strong>driver_entry</strong>
structure that points to the other functions in the driver. The
<strong>driver_init</strong> function is declared with a macro,
<strong>DRIVER_INIT(drivername)</strong>. (This is because different
operating systems have different names for it.)When writing a driver in C++, the driver entry is to be of
<strong>"C"</strong> linkage. One way to do this is to put the
following line somewhere before the driver entry:<pre>
extern "C" DRIVER_INIT(drivername);</pre>When the driver has passed the <strong>driver_entry</strong> over to
the emulator, the driver is <em>not</em> allowed to modify the
<strong>driver_entry</strong>.If compiling a driver for static inclusion through
<strong>--enable-static-drivers</strong>, you must define
<strong>STATIC_ERLANG_DRIVER</strong> before the <strong>DRIVER_INIT</strong> declaration.</p><h2>Data Types</h2><p><strong>ErlDrvEntry</strong></p><pre><code class="">

The driver is to return a number &gt;= 0 or a pointer, or, if the
driver cannot be started, one of three error codes:</p> <dl><dt><strong>ERL_DRV_ERROR_GENERAL</strong></dt><dd>General error, no error code</dd><dt><strong>ERL_DRV_ERROR_ERRNO</strong></dt><dd>Error with error code in <strong>errno</strong></dd><dt><strong>ERL_DRV_ERROR_BADARG</strong></dt><dd>Error, <strong>badarg</strong></dd></dl> <p>If an error code is returned, the port is not started.</p> </dd><dt><a name="stop"></a><strong>void (*stop)(ErlDrvData drv_data)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Called when the port is closed, with
<a href="./erlang#port_close/1">erlang#port_close/1</a> or <strong>Port ! {self(), close}</strong>.
Notice that terminating the port owner process also closes the
port. If <strong>drv_data</strong> is a pointer to memory allocated in
<strong>start</strong>, then <strong>stop</strong> is the place to deallocate that
memory.</p> </dd><dt><a name="output"></a> <strong>void (*output)(ErlDrvData drv_data, char *buf, ErlDrvSizeT len)</strong> </dt><dd> <p>Called when an Erlang process has sent data to the port. The data is
pointed to by <strong>buf</strong>, and is <strong>len</strong> bytes. Data is sent to
the port with <strong>Port ! {self(), {command, Data}}</strong> or with
<strong>erlang:port_command/2</strong>. Depending on how the port was
opened, it is to be either a list of integers <strong>0...255</strong> or a
binary. See <a href="./erlang#open_port/2">erlang#open_port/2</a> and
<a href="./erlang#port_command/2">erlang#port_command/2</a>.</p> </dd><dt><a name="ready_input"></a> <strong>void (*ready_input)(ErlDrvData drv_data, ErlDrvEvent event)</strong> </dt><dd></dd><dt><a name="ready_output"></a> <strong>void (*ready_output)(ErlDrvData drv_data, ErlDrvEvent event)</strong> </dt><dd> <p>Called when a driver event (specified in parameter
<strong>event</strong>) is signaled. This is used to help
asynchronous drivers "wake up" when something occurs.</p> <p>On Unix the <strong>event</strong> is a pipe or socket handle (or
something that the <strong>select</strong> system call understands).</p> <p>On Windows the <strong>event</strong> is an <strong>Event</strong> or <strong>Semaphore</strong>
(or something that the <strong>WaitForMultipleObjects</strong> API
function understands). (Some trickery in the emulator allows
more than the built-in limit of 64 <strong>Events</strong> to be used.)</p> <p>To use this with threads and asynchronous routines, create a
pipe on Unix and an <strong>Event</strong> on Windows. When the routine
completes, write to the pipe (use <strong>SetEvent</strong> on
Windows), this makes the emulator call
<strong>ready_input</strong> or <strong>ready_output</strong>.</p> <p>False events can occur. That is, calls to <strong>ready_input</strong>
or <strong>ready_output</strong> although no real events are signaled. In
reality, it is rare (and OS-dependant), but a robust driver
must nevertheless be able to handle such cases.</p> </dd><dt><a name="driver_name"></a><strong>char *driver_name</strong></dt><dd> <p>The driver name. It must correspond to the atom used in
<a href="./erlang#open_port/2">erlang#open_port/2</a>, and the name of the driver
library file (without the extension).</p> </dd><dt><a name="finish"></a><strong>void (*finish)(void)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Called by the <strong>erl_ddll</strong> driver when the
driver is unloaded. (It is only called in dynamic drivers.)</p> <p>The driver is only unloaded as a result of calling
<a href="../kernel/erl_ddll#unload_driver/1">kernel/erl_ddll#unload_driver/1</a>,
or when the emulator halts.</p> </dd><dt><strong>void *handle</strong></dt><dd> <p>This field is reserved for the emulator's internal use. The
emulator will modify this field, so it is important
that the <strong>driver_entry</strong> is not declared <strong>const</strong>.</p>  </dd><dt><a name="control"></a> <strong>ErlDrvSSizeT (*control)(ErlDrvData drv_data, unsigned int command, char *buf, ErlDrvSizeT len, char **rbuf, ErlDrvSizeT rlen)</strong></dt><dd> <p>A special routine invoked with
<a href="./erlang#port_control/3">erlang#port_control/3</a>.
It works a little like an "ioctl" for
Erlang drivers. The data specified to <strong>port_control/3</strong>
arrives in <strong>buf</strong> and <strong>len</strong>. The driver can send
data back, using <strong>*rbuf</strong> and <strong>rlen</strong>.</p> <p>This is the fastest way of calling a driver and get a
response. It makes no context switch in the Erlang
emulator and requires no message passing. It is suitable
for calling C function to get faster execution, when Erlang
is too slow.</p> <p>If the driver wants to return data, it is to return it in
<strong>rbuf</strong>. When <strong>control</strong> is called,
<strong>*rbuf</strong> points to a default buffer of <strong>rlen</strong> bytes, which
can be used to return data. Data is returned differently depending on
the port control flags (those that are set with
<a href="./erl_driver#set_port_control_flags">erl_driver#set_port_control_flags</a>).</p> <p>If the flag is set to <strong>PORT_CONTROL_FLAG_BINARY</strong>,
a binary is returned. Small binaries can be returned by writing
the raw data into the default buffer. A binary can also be
returned by setting <strong>*rbuf</strong> to point to a binary allocated with
<a href="./erl_driver#driver_alloc_binary">erl_driver#driver_alloc_binary</a>.
This binary is freed automatically after <strong>control</strong> has returned.
The driver can retain the binary for <em>read only</em> access with
<a href="./erl_driver#driver_binary_inc_refc">erl_driver#driver_binary_inc_refc</a> to be freed later
with <a href="./erl_driver#driver_free_binary">erl_driver#driver_free_binary</a>.
It is never allowed to change the binary after <strong>control</strong> has
returned. If <strong>*rbuf</strong> is set to <strong>NULL</strong>, an empty list is
returned.</p> <p>If the flag is set to <strong>0</strong>, data is returned as a
list of integers. Either use the default buffer or set
<strong>*rbuf</strong> to point to a larger buffer allocated with
<a href="./erl_driver#driver_alloc">erl_driver#driver_alloc</a>. The
buffer is freed automatically after <strong>control</strong> has returned.</p> <p>Using binaries is faster if more than a few bytes are returned.</p> <p>The return value is the number of bytes returned in <strong>*rbuf</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><a name="timeout"></a><strong>void (*timeout)(ErlDrvData drv_data)</strong> </dt><dd> <p>Called any time after the driver's timer reaches <strong>0</strong>.
The timer is activated with
<a href="./erl_driver#driver_set_timer">erl_driver#driver_set_timer</a>. No priorities or
ordering exist among drivers, so if several drivers time out at
the same time, anyone of them is called first.</p> </dd><dt><a name="outputv"></a> <strong>void (*outputv)(ErlDrvData drv_data, ErlIOVec *ev)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Called whenever the port is written to. If
it is <strong>NULL</strong>, the <strong>output</strong> function is called
instead. This function is faster than <strong>output</strong>, as
it takes an <strong>ErlIOVec</strong> directly, which requires no
copying of the data. The port is to be in binary mode, see
<a href="./erlang#open_port/2">erlang#open_port/2</a>.</p> <p><strong>ErlIOVec</strong> contains both a <strong>SysIOVec</strong>,
suitable for <strong>writev</strong>, and one or more binaries. If
these binaries are to be retained when the driver returns
from <strong>outputv</strong>, they can be queued (using, for example,
<a href="./erl_driver#driver_enq_bin">erl_driver#driver_enq_bin</a>)
or, if they are kept in a static or global
variable, the reference counter can be incremented.</p> </dd><dt><a name="ready_async"></a> <strong>void (*ready_async)(ErlDrvData drv_data, ErlDrvThreadData thread_data)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Called after an asynchronous call has completed.
The asynchronous call is started with
<a href="./erl_driver#driver_async">erl_driver#driver_async</a>.
This function is called from the Erlang emulator thread, as
opposed to the asynchronous function, which is called in
some thread (if multi-threading is enabled).</p> </dd><dt><strong>void (*flush)(ErlDrvData drv_data)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Called when the port is about to be closed,
and there is data in the driver queue that must be flushed
before 'stop' can be called.</p> </dd><dt><a name="call"></a><strong>ErlDrvSSizeT (*call)(ErlDrvData drv_data, unsigned int command, char *buf, ErlDrvSizeT len, char **rbuf, ErlDrvSizeT rlen, unsigned int *flags)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Called from <a href="./erlang#port_call/3">erlang#port_call/3</a>.
It works a lot like the <strong>control</strong> callback, but uses the
external term format for input and output.</p> <p><strong>command</strong> is an integer, obtained from the call from
Erlang (the second argument to <strong>erlang:port_call/3</strong>).</p> <p><strong>buf</strong> and <strong>len</strong> provide the arguments to the call
(the third argument to <strong>erlang:port_call/3</strong>). They can
be decoded using <strong>ei</strong> functions.</p> <p><strong>rbuf</strong> points to a return buffer, <strong>rlen</strong> bytes
long. The return data is to be a valid Erlang term in the
external (binary) format. This is converted to an Erlang
term and returned by <strong>erlang:port_call/3</strong> to the
caller. If more space than <strong>rlen</strong> bytes is needed to
return data, <strong>*rbuf</strong> can be set to memory allocated with
<a href="./erl_driver#driver_alloc">erl_driver#driver_alloc</a>.
This memory is freed automatically after <strong>call</strong> has returned.</p> <p>The return value is the number of bytes returned in
<strong>*rbuf</strong>. If <strong>ERL_DRV_ERROR_GENERAL</strong> is returned
(or in fact, anything &lt; 0), <strong>erlang:port_call/3</strong>
throws a <strong>BAD_ARG</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>void (*event)(ErlDrvData drv_data, ErlDrvEvent event, ErlDrvEventData event_data)</strong></dt><dd> <p>Intentionally left undocumented.</p> </dd><dt><a name="extended_marker"></a><strong>int extended_marker</strong></dt><dd> <p>This field is either to be equal to <strong>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MARKER</strong>
or <strong>0</strong>. An old driver (not aware of the extended driver
interface) is to set this field to <strong>0</strong>. If this field is
<strong>0</strong>, all the following fields <em>must</em> also be <strong>0</strong>,
or <strong>NULL</strong> if it is a pointer field.</p> </dd><dt><strong>int major_version</strong></dt><dd> <p>This field is to equal <strong>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MAJOR_VERSION</strong> if

<strong>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MARKER</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><a name="driver_flags"></a><strong>int driver_flags</strong></dt><dd> <p>This field is used to pass driver capability and other
information to the runtime system. If
field <strong>extended_marker</strong> equals <strong>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MARKER</strong>,
it is to contain <strong>0</strong> or driver flags (<strong>ERL_DRV_FLAG_*</strong>)
OR'ed bitwise. The following driver flags exist:</p> <dl><dt><strong>ERL_DRV_FLAG_USE_PORT_LOCKING</strong></dt><dd> <p>The runtime system uses port-level locking on
all ports executing this driver instead of driver-level
locking when the driver is run in a runtime
system with SMP support. For more information, see
<a href="./erl_driver#smp_support">erl_driver#smp_support</a>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>ERL_DRV_FLAG_SOFT_BUSY</strong></dt><dd> <p>Marks that driver instances can handle being called

although a driver instance has marked itself as busy (see
<a href="./erl_driver#set_busy_port">erl_driver#set_busy_port</a>).
As from ERTS 5.7.4 this flag is required for drivers used
by the Erlang distribution (the behavior has always been
