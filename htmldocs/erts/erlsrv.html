versions of Windows). It allows Erlang
emulators to run as services on the Windows system, allowing embedded
systems to start without any user needing to log on. The
emulator started in this way can be manipulated through the
Windows services applet in a manner similar to other services.Notice that <strong>erlsrv</strong> is not a general service utility for Windows,
but designed for embedded Erlang systems.<strong>erlsrv</strong> also provides a command-line interface for registering,
changing, starting, and stopping services.To manipulate services, the logged on user is to have
administrator privileges on the machine. The Erlang machine
itself is (default) run as the local administrator. This can be
changed with the Services applet in Windows.The processes created by the service can, as opposed to normal
services, be "killed" with the task manager. Killing an emulator
that is started by a service triggers the "OnFail" action
specified for that service, which can be a reboot.The following parameters can be specified for each Erlang service:<dl><dt><strong>StopAction</strong></dt><dd> <p>Tells <strong>erlsrv</strong> how to stop
the Erlang emulator. Default is to kill it (Win32
TerminateProcess), but this action can specify any Erlang
shell command that will be executed in the emulator to make
it stop. The emulator is expected to stop within 30 seconds
after the command is issued in the shell. If the emulator is
not stopped, it reports a running state to the service
manager.</p> </dd><dt><strong>OnFail</strong></dt><dd> <p>Can be one of the following:</p> <dl><dt><strong>reboot</strong></dt><dd> <p>The Windows system is rebooted whenever the emulator stops
(a more simple form of watchdog). This can be useful for
less critical systems, otherwise use the heart functionality
to accomplish this.</p> </dd><dt><strong>restart</strong></dt><dd> <p>Makes the Erlang emulator be
restarted (with whatever parameters are registered for the
service at the occasion) when it stops. If the emulator
stops again within 10 seconds, it is not restarted to avoid
an infinite loop, which could hang the Windows system.</p> </dd><dt><strong>restart_always</strong></dt><dd> <p>Similar to <strong>restart</strong>, but does
not try to detect cyclic restarts; it is expected that
some other mechanism is present to avoid the problem.</p> </dd><dt><strong>ignore</strong> (the default)</dt><dd> <p>Reports the service as stopped to the service manager
whenever it fails; it must be manually restarted.</p> </dd></dl> <p>On a system where release handling is used,
this is always to be set to <strong>ignore</strong>. Use
<strong>heart</strong> to restart the service on failure
instead.</p> </dd><dt><strong>Machine</strong></dt><dd> <p>The location of the Erlang emulator.
The default is the <strong>erl.exe</strong> located in the same
directory as <strong>erlsrv.exe</strong>. Do not specify
<strong>werl.exe</strong> as this emulator, it will not work.</p> <p>If the system uses release handling, this is to be set to a
program similar to <strong>start_erl.exe</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>Env</strong></dt><dd> <p>Specifies an <em>extra</em> environment
for the emulator. The environment variables specified
here are added to the system-wide environment block that is
normally present when a service starts up. Variables present
in both the system-wide environment and in the service
environment specification will be set to the value specified
in the service.</p> </dd><dt><strong>WorkDir</strong></dt><dd> <p>The working directory for the Erlang emulator.
Must be on a local drive (no network drives are mounted when a
service starts). Default working directory for services is
<strong>%SystemDrive%%SystemPath%</strong>.
Debug log files will be placed in this directory.</p> </dd><dt><strong>Priority</strong></dt><dd> <p>The process priority of the emulator. Can be one of the
following:</p> <dl><dt><strong>realtime</strong></dt><dd> <p>Not recommended, as the machine will possibly be
inaccessible to interactive users.</p> </dd><dt><strong>high</strong></dt><dd> <p>Can be used if two Erlang nodes are to reside on one dedicated
system and one is to have precedence over the other.</p> </dd><dt><strong>low</strong></dt><dd> <p>Can be used if interactive performance is not to be affected
by the emulator process.</p> </dd><dt><strong>default</strong> (the default&gt;</dt><dd> </dd></dl> </dd><dt><strong>SName or Name</strong></dt><dd> <p>Specifies the short or long
node name of the Erlang emulator. The Erlang services are
always distributed. Default is to use the service name as
(short) nodename.</p> </dd><dt><strong>DebugType</strong></dt><dd> <p>Specifies that output from the Erlang shell is to be
sent to a "debug log". The log file is named
&lt;servicename&gt;<strong>.debug</strong> or
&lt;servicename&gt;<strong>.debug.</strong>&lt;N&gt;,
where &lt;N&gt; is an integer from 1 through 99.
The log file is placed in the working directory of the
service (as specified in <strong>WorkDir</strong>).</p> <p>Can be one of the following:</p> <dl><dt><strong>new</strong></dt><dd> <p>Uses a separate log file for every invocation of the service
(&lt;servicename&gt;<strong>.debug.</strong>&lt;N&gt;).</p> </dd><dt><strong>reuse</strong></dt><dd> <p>Reuses the same log file
(&lt;servicename&gt;<strong>.debug</strong>).</p> </dd><dt><strong>console</strong></dt><dd> <p>Opens an interactive Windows console window for the Erlang
shell of the service. Automatically disables the
<strong>StopAction</strong>. A service started with an
interactive console window does not survive logouts.
<strong>OnFail</strong> actions do not work with
debug consoles either.</p> </dd><dt><strong>none</strong> (the default)</dt><dd> <p>The output of the Erlang shell is discarded.</p> </dd></dl> <div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>The <strong>console</strong> option is <em>not</em> intended
for production. It is <em>only</em> a convenient way to debug
Erlang services during development.</p><p>The <strong>new</strong> and <strong>reuse</strong> options
might seem convenient in a production system, but consider that
the logs grow indefinitely during the system lifetime and cannot
be truncated, except if the service is restarted.</p><p>In short, the <strong>DebugType</strong> is
intended for debugging only. Logs during production are
better produced with the standard Erlang logging facilities.</p></div> </dd><dt><strong>Args</strong></dt><dd> <p>Passes extra arguments to the emulator startup program
<strong>erl.exe</strong> (or <strong>start_erl.exe</strong>).
Arguments that cannot be specified here are
<strong>-noinput</strong> (<strong>StopActions</strong> would not work),
<strong>-name</strong>, and <strong>-sname</strong> (they are
specified in any way). The most common use is for specifying cookies
and flags to be passed to <strong>init:boot()</strong>
(<strong>-s</strong>).</p> </dd><dt><strong>InternalServiceName</strong></dt><dd> <p>Specifies the Windows-internal service name (not the display name,
which is the one <strong>erlsrv</strong> uses to identify the service).</p> <p>This internal name cannot be changed, it is fixed even if the
service is renamed. <strong>erlsrv</strong> generates a unique internal name
when a service is created. It is recommended to keep to the default
if release handling is to be used for the application.</p> <p>The internal service name can be seen in the Windows service
manager if viewing <strong>Properties</strong> for an Erlang service.</p> </dd><dt><strong>Comment</strong></dt><dd> <p>A textual comment describing the service. Not mandatory, but shows
up as the service description in the Windows service manager.</p> </dd></dl><a name="001"></a>
The naming of the service in a system that
uses release handling must follow the convention
<em>NodeName</em>_<em>Release</em>, where <em>NodeName</em> is
the first part of the Erlang node name (up to, but not including
the "@") and <em>Release</em> is the current release of the
application.</p><h1>Functions</h1><h2>erlsrv {set | add} &lt;service-name&gt; [&lt;service options&gt;]</h2><p>Add or modify an Erlang service.</p><p>The <strong>set</strong> and <strong>add</strong> commands modifies or adds an Erlang
service, respectively. The simplest form of an <strong>add</strong> command is
without any options in which case all default values
(described above) apply. The service name is mandatory.</p><p>Every option can be specified without parameters, the
default value is then applied. Values to the options are
supplied <em>only</em> when the default is not to be used.
For example, <strong>erlsrv set myservice -prio -arg</strong>
sets the default priority and removes all arguments.</p><p>Service options:</p><dl><dt><strong>-st[opaction] [&lt;erlang shell command&gt;]</strong></dt><dd> <p>Defines the <strong>StopAction</strong>, the command given
to the Erlang shell when the service is stopped.
Default is none.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-on[fail] [{reboot | restart | restart_always}]</strong></dt><dd> <p>The action to take when the Erlang emulator
stops unexpectedly. Default is to ignore.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-m[achine] [&lt;erl-command&gt;]</strong></dt><dd> <p>The complete path to the Erlang emulator. Never use the
<strong>werl</strong> program for this. Defaults to the
<strong>erl.exe</strong> in the same directory as
<strong>erlsrv.exe</strong>. When release handling
is used, this is to be set to a program similar to
<strong>start_erl.exe</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-e[nv] [&lt;variable&gt;[=&lt;value&gt;]] ...</strong></dt><dd> <p>Edits the environment block for the service. Every
environment variable specified is added to the system
environment block. If a variable specified here has the same
name as a system-wide environment variable, the specified
value overrides the system-wide. Environment variables are
added to this list by specifying
&lt;variable&gt;=&lt;value&gt; and deleted from the list by
specifying &lt;variable&gt; alone. The environment block is
automatically sorted. Any number of <strong>-env</strong>
options can be specified in one command. Default is to use the
system environment block unmodified (except for two additions,
see section <a href="#002">Environment</a>
below).</p> </dd><dt><strong>-w[orkdir] [&lt;directory&gt;]</strong></dt><dd> <p>The initial working directory of the Erlang
emulator. Defaults to the system directory.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-p[riority] [{low|high|realtime}]</strong></dt><dd> <p>The priority of the Erlang emulator. Default to the
Windows default priority.</p> </dd><dt><strong>{-sn[ame] | -n[ame]} [&lt;node-name&gt;]</strong></dt><dd> <p>The node name of the Erlang machine. Distribution is mandatory.
Defaults to <strong>-sname &lt;service name&gt;</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-d[ebugtype] [{new|reuse|console}]</strong></dt><dd> <p>Specifies where shell output is to be sent.
Default is that shell output is discarded.
To be used only for debugging.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-ar[gs] [&lt;limited erl arguments&gt;]</strong></dt><dd> <p>Extra arguments to the Erlang emulator. Avoid
<strong>-noinput</strong>, <strong>-noshell</strong>, and
<strong>-sname</strong>/<strong>-name</strong>. Default is
no extra arguments. Remember that the services cookie file is not
necessarily the same as the interactive users. The service
runs as the local administrator. Specify all arguments
together in one string, use double quotes (") to specify an
argument string containing spaces, and use quoted quotes (\")
to specify a quote within the argument string if necessary.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-i[nternalservicename] [&lt;internal name&gt;]</strong></dt><dd> <p><em>Only</em> allowed for <strong>add</strong>. Specifies a
Windows-internal service name for the service, which by
default is set to something unique (prefixed with the
original service name) by <strong>erlsrv</strong> when adding a new
service. Specifying this is a purely cosmethic action and is
<em>not</em> recommended if release handling is to be
performed. The internal service name cannot be changed once
the service is created. The internal name is <em>not</em> to
be confused with the ordinary service name, which is the name
used to identify a service to <strong>erlsrv</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>-c[omment] [&lt;short description&gt;]</strong></dt><dd> <p>Specifies a textual comment describing the
service. This comment shows up as the service description
in the Windows service manager.</p> </dd></dl><h2>erlsrv {start | start_disabled | stop | disable |
        enable} &lt;service-name&gt;</h2><p>Manipulate the current service status.</p><p>These commands are only added for convenience, the normal
way to manipulate the state of a service is through the
control panels services applet.</p><p>The <strong>start</strong> and
<strong>stop</strong> commands communicates
with the service manager for starting and stopping a
service. The commands wait until the service is
started or stopped. When disabling a service, it is not
stopped, the disabled state does not take effect until the
service is stopped. Enabling a service sets it in
automatic mode, which is started at boot. This command cannot
set the service to manual.</p><p>The <strong>start_disabled</strong> command operates on a service
regardless of if it is enabled/disabled or started/stopped. It
does this by first enabling it (regardless of if it is enabled
or not), then starting it (if not already started), and
then disabling it. The result is a disabled but started
service, regardless of its earlier state. This is useful for
starting services temporarily during a release upgrade. The
difference between using <strong>start_disabled</strong> and the
sequence <strong>enable</strong>, <strong>start</strong>, and <strong>disable</strong> is
that all other <strong>erlsrv</strong> commands are locked out during
the sequence of operations in <strong>start_disable</strong>, making the
operation atomic from an <strong>erlsrv</strong> user's point of view.</p><h2>erlsrv remove &lt;service-name&gt;</h2><p>Remove the service.</p><p>Removes the service completely with all its registered
options. It is stopped before it is removed.</p><h2>erlsrv list [&lt;service-name&gt;]</h2><p>List all Erlang services or all options for one service. </p><p>If no service name is specified, a brief listing of all Erlang
services is presented. If a service name is supplied, all options
for that service are presented.</p><h2>erlsrv help</h2><p>Display a brief help text.</p><p>Displays a brief help text.</p><h2>Environment</h2><p><a name="002"></a>
The environment of an Erlang machine started
as a service contains two special variables:</p><dl><dt><strong>ERLSRV_SERVICE_NAME</strong></dt><dd>The name of the service that started the machine.</dd><dt><strong>ERLSRV_EXECUTABLE</strong></dt><dd>The full path to the <strong>erlsrv.exe</strong>, which can be used to manipulate the service. This comes in handy when defining a heart command for your service.</dd></dl><p>A command file for restarting a service looks as follows:</p><pre><code class="">
@echo off
%ERLSRV_EXECUTABLE% stop %ERLSRV_SERVICE_NAME%
%ERLSRV_EXECUTABLE% start %ERLSRV_SERVICE_NAME%    </code></pre><p>This command file is then set as heart command.</p><p>The environment variables can also be used to detect that we
are running as a service and make port programs react correctly
to the control events generated on logout (see the next section).</p><h2>Port Programs</h2><p>When a program runs in
the service context, it must handle the control events that are
sent to every program in the system when the interactive user
logs off. This is done in different ways for programs running in
the console subsystem and programs running as window
applications. An application running in the console subsystem
(normal for port programs) uses the win32 function
<strong>SetConsoleCtrlHandler</strong> to register a control handler
that returns <strong>true</strong> in answer to the
<strong>CTRL_LOGOFF_EVENT</strong>
and <strong>CTRL_SHUTDOWN_EVENT</strong> events. Other applications
only forward <strong>WM_ENDSESSION</strong> and
<strong>WM_QUERYENDSESSION</strong> to the default window procedure.</p><p>A brief example in C of how to set the console control handler:</p><pre><code class="">
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
/* 
** A Console control handler that ignores the log off events,
** and lets the default handler take care of other events.
*/   
BOOL WINAPI service_aware_handler(DWORD ctrl){
    if(ctrl == CTRL_LOGOFF_EVENT)
        return TRUE;
    if(ctrl == CTRL_SHUTDOWN_EVENT)
        return TRUE;
    return FALSE;
}

void initialize_handler(void){
    char buffer[2];
    /* 
     * We assume we are running as a service if this  
     * environment variable is defined.
     */
    if(GetEnvironmentVariable("ERLSRV_SERVICE_NAME",buffer,
                              (DWORD) 2)){
        /*
        ** Actually set the control handler
        */
        SetConsoleCtrlHandler(&amp;service_aware_handler, TRUE);
    }
}    </code></pre><h2>Notes</h2><p>Although the options are described in a Unix-like format, the case of
the options or commands is not relevant, and both character "/" and "-"
can be used for options.</p><p>Notice that the program resides in the emulator's <strong>bin</strong>
directory, not in the <strong>bin</strong> directory directly under
the Erlang root. The reasons for this are the subtle problem of
upgrading the emulator on a running system, where a new version of
the runtime system should not need to overwrite existing (and probably
used) executables.</p><p>To manipulate the Erlang services easily, put
the <strong>&lt;erlang_root&gt;\erts-&lt;version&gt;\bin</strong> directory in
the path instead of <strong>&lt;erlang_root&gt;\bin</strong>. The
<strong>erlsrv</strong> program can be found from inside Erlang by using the
<strong>os:find_executable/1</strong> Erlang function.</p><p>For release handling to work, use <strong>start_erl</strong> as the
Erlang machine. As stated <a href="#001">above</a>,
the service name is significant.</p><h2>See Also</h2><p><a href="start_erl">start_erl</a>,
