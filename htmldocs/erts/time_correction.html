has been extended. This includes a
<a href="#The_New_Time_API">new API</a>
for time and
<a href="#Time_Warp_Modes">time warp modes</a> that change the system behavior when
system time changes.</p><p>The <a href="#No_Time_Warp_Mode">default time warp mode</a> has the same behavior as before, and the
old API still works. Thus, you are not required to change
anything unless you want to. However, <em>you are strongly encouraged to use the new API</em> instead of the old API based
on <a href="./erlang#now/0">erlang#now/0</a>.
<strong>erlang:now/0</strong> is deprecated, as it is and
will be a scalability bottleneck.</p><p>By using the new API, you
automatically get scalability and performance improvements. This
also enables you to use the
<a href="#Multi_Time_Warp_Mode">multi-time warp mode</a>
that improves accuracy and precision of time measurements.</p></div><h2>Terminology</h2><p>To make it easier to understand this section, some terms
are defined. This is a mix of our own terminology
(Erlang/OS system time, Erlang/OS monotonic time, time warp)
and globally accepted terminology.</p><a name="Monotonically_Increasing"></a><h2>Monotonically Increasing</h2><p>In a monotonically increasing sequence of values, all values
that have a predecessor are either larger than or equal to its
predecessor.</p><a name="Strictly_Monotonically_Increasing"></a><h2>Strictly Monotonically Increasing</h2><p>In a strictly monotonically increasing sequence of values,
all values that have a predecessor are larger than its
predecessor.</p><a name="UT1"></a><h2>UT1</h2><p>Universal Time. UT1 is based on the rotation of the earth
and conceptually means solar time at 0Â° longitude.</p><a name="UTC"></a><h2>UTC</h2><p>Coordinated Universal Time. UTC almost aligns with
<a href="#UT1">UT1</a>. However, UTC uses the
SI definition of a second, which has not exactly the same length
as the second used by UT1. This means that UTC slowly drifts from
UT1. To keep UTC relatively in sync with UT1, leap seconds
are inserted, and potentially also deleted. That is, an UTC day can
be 86400, 86401, or 86399 seconds long.</p><a name="POSIX_Time"></a><h2>POSIX Time</h2><p>Time since
<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/xrat/V4_xbd_chap03.html#tag_21_03_00_17"> Epoch</a>.
Epoch is defined to be 00:00:00 <a href="#UTC">UTC</a>,
1970-01-01.
<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009604499/basedefs/xbd_chap04.html#tag_04_14"> A day in POSIX time</a>
is defined to be exactly 86400 seconds long. Strangely enough,
Epoch is defined to be a time in UTC, and UTC has another
definition of how long a day is. Quoting the Open Group
<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/xrat/V4_xbd_chap04.html#tag_21_04_15"> "POSIX time is therefore not necessarily UTC, despite its appearance"</a>.
The effect of this is that when an UTC leap second is
inserted, POSIX time either stops for a second, or repeats the
last second. If an UTC leap second would be deleted (which has not
happened yet), POSIX time would make a one second leap forward.</p><a name="Time_Resolution"></a><h2>Time Resolution</h2><p>The shortest time interval that can be distinguished when

everything that has anything to do with time. All timers,

<a href="./erlang#time_offset/0">erlang#time_offset/0</a>.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Time is vital to an Erlang program and, more importantly, <em>correct</em>
time is vital to an Erlang program. As Erlang is a language with
soft real-time properties and we can express
time in our programs, the Virtual Machine and the language must be
careful about what is considered a correct time and in
how time functions behave.</p><p>When Erlang was designed, it was assumed that the wall
clock time in the system showed a monotonic time moving forward at
exactly the same pace as the definition of time. This more or less meant
that an atomic clock (or better time source) was expected to be attached
to your hardware and that the hardware was then expected to be
locked away from any human tinkering forever. While this can be a
compelling thought, it is simply never the case.</p><p>A "normal" modern computer cannot keep time, not on itself and
not unless you have a chip-level atomic clock wired to it. Time,
as perceived by your computer, must normally be corrected. Hence
the Network Time Protocol (NTP) protocol, together with the <strong>ntpd</strong>
process, does its best to keep your computer time in sync with
the correct time. Between NTP corrections, usually a
less potent time-keeper than an atomic clock is used.</p><p>However, NTP is not fail-safe. The NTP server can be unavailable,
<strong>ntp.conf</strong> can be wrongly configured, or your computer can
sometimes be disconnected from Internet. Furthermore, you can have a
user (or even system administrator) who thinks the correct
way to handle Daylight Saving Time is to adjust the clock one
hour two times a year (which is the incorrect way to do it).
To complicate things further, this user fetched your
software from Internet and has not considered what
the correct time is as perceived by a computer. The user does
not care about keeping the wall clock in sync with the correct
time. The user expects your program to have unlimited knowledge
about the time.</p><p>Most programmers also expect time to be reliable, at least until
they realize that the wall clock time on their workstation is off by
a minute. Then they set it to the correct time, but most probably
not in a smooth way.</p><p>The number of problems that arise when you always expect the wall clock
time on the system to be correct can be immense. Erlang therefore
introduced the "corrected estimate of time", or the "time
correction", many years ago. The time correction relies on the fact
that most operating systems have some kind of monotonic clock,
either a real-time extension or some built-in "tick counter" that is
independent of the wall clock settings. This counter can have
microsecond resolution or much less, but it has a drift that cannot
be ignored.</p><a name="Time_Correction"></a><h2>Time Correction</h2><p>If time correction is enabled, the Erlang runtime system
makes use of both
<a href="#OS_System_Time">OS system time</a>
and <a href="#OS_Monotonic_Time">OS monotonic time</a>,
to adjust the frequency of the Erlang
monotonic clock. Time correction ensures that
<a href="#Erlang_Monotonic_Time">Erlang monotonic time</a>
does not warp and that the frequency is relatively accurate.
The type of frequency adjustments depends on the time warp mode used.
Section <a href="#Time_Warp_Modes">Time Warp Modes</a>
provides more details.</p><p>By default time correction is enabled if support for
it exists on the specific platform. Support for it includes
both OS monotonic time, provided by the OS, and an
implementation in the Erlang runtime system using
OS monotonic time. To check if your system has support
for OS monotonic time, call
<a href="./erlang#system_info_os_monotonic_time_source">erlang#system_info_os_monotonic_time_source</a>.
To check if time correction is enabled on your system, call
<a href="./erlang#system_info_time_correction">erlang#system_info_time_correction</a>.</p><p>To enable or disable time correction, pass command-line argument
<a href="./erl#+c">erl#+c</a> to
<a href="erl">erl</a>.</p><p>If time correction is disabled, Erlang monotonic time
can warp forwards or stop, or even freeze for extended
periods of time. There are then no guarantees that the frequency
of the Erlang monotonic clock is accurate or stable.</p><p><em>You typically never want to disable time correction</em>.
Previously a performance penalty was associated with time
correction, but nowadays it is usually the other way around.
If time correction is disabled, you probably get bad scalability,
bad performance, and bad time measurements.</p><a name="Time_Warp_Safe_Code"></a><h2>Time Warp Safe Code</h2><p>Time warp safe code can handle
a <a href="#Time_Warp">time warp</a> of
<a href="#Erlang_System_Time">Erlang system time</a>.</p><p><a href="./erlang#now/0">erlang#now/0</a>
behaves bad when Erlang system time warps. When Erlang
system time does a time warp backwards, the values returned
from <strong>erlang:now/0</strong> freeze (if you disregard the
microsecond increments made because of the actual call) until
OS system time reaches the point of the last value returned by
<strong>erlang:now/0</strong>. This freeze can continue for a long time. It
can take years, decades, and even longer until the freeze stops.</p><p>All uses of <strong>erlang:now/0</strong> are not necessarily
time warp unsafe. If you do not use it to get time, it
is time warp safe. However, <em>all uses of erlang:now/0 are suboptimal</em> from a performance
and scalability perspective. So you really want to replace
the use of it with other functionality. For examples
of how to replace the use of <strong>erlang:now/0</strong>, see section
<a href="#Dos_and_Donts">How to Work with the New API</a>.</p><h2>Time Warp Modes</h2><a name="Time_Warp_Modes"></a><p>Current <a href="#Erlang_System_Time">Erlang system time</a> is determined by adding the current
<a href="./erlang#monotonic_time/0">Erlang monotonic time</a>
with current
<a href="./erlang#time_offset/0">time offset</a>. The
time offset is managed differently depending on which time
warp mode you use.</p><p>To set the time warp mode, pass command-line argument
<a href="./erl#+C_">erl#+C_</a> to
<a href="erl">erl</a>.</p><a name="No_Time_Warp_Mode"></a><h2>No Time Warp Mode</h2><p>The time offset is determined at runtime system start
and does not change later. This is the default behavior, but
not because it is the best mode (which it is not). It is
default <em>only</em> because this is how the runtime system
behaved until ERTS 7.0.
Ensure that your Erlang code that can execute during a time
warp is <a href="#Time_Warp_Safe_Code">time warp safe</a> before enabling other modes.</p><p>As the time offset is not allowed to change, time
correction must adjust the frequency of the Erlang
monotonic clock to align Erlang system time with OS
system time smoothly. A significant downside of this approach
is that we on purpose will use a faulty frequency on the
Erlang monotonic clock if adjustments are needed. This
error can be as large as 1%. This error will show up in all
time measurements in the runtime system.</p><p>If time correction is not enabled, Erlang monotonic
time freezes when OS system time leaps backwards.
The freeze of monotonic time continues until
OS system time catches up. The freeze can continue for
a long time. When OS system time leaps forwards,
Erlang monotonic time also leaps forward.</p><a name="Single_Time_Warp_Mode"></a><h2>Single Time Warp Mode</h2><p>This mode is more or less a backward compatibility mode
as from its introduction.</p><p>On an embedded system it is not uncommon that the system
has no power supply, not even a battery, when it is
shut off. The system clock on such a system is typically
way off when the system boots. If
<a href="#No_Time_Warp_Mode">no time warp mode</a>
is used, and the Erlang runtime system is started before
OS system time has been corrected, Erlang system time
can be wrong for a long time, centuries or even longer.</p><p>If you need to use Erlang code that is not
<a href="#Time_Warp_Safe_Code">time warp safe</a>,
and you need to start the Erlang runtime system before OS
system time has been corrected, you may want to use the single
time warp mode.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>There are limitations to when you can
execute time warp unsafe code using this mode. If it is possible
to use time warp safe code only, it is <em>much</em> better
to use the <a href="#Multi_Time_Warp_Mode">multi-time warp mode</a> instead.</p></div><p>Using the single time warp mode, the time offset is
handled in two phases:</p><dl><dt>Preliminary Phase</dt><dd> <p>This phase starts when the runtime
system starts. A preliminary time offset based on
current OS system time is determined. This offset is from
now on to be fixed during the whole preliminary phase.</p> <p>If time correction is enabled, adjustments to the
Erlang monotonic clock are made to keep its
frequency as correct as possible. However, <em>no</em>
adjustments are made trying to align Erlang system
time and OS system time. That is, during the preliminary phase
Erlang system time and OS system time can diverge
from each other, and no attempt is made to prevent this.</p> <p>If time correction is disabled, changes in OS system
time affects the monotonic clock the same way as
when the <a href="#No_Time_Warp_Mode">no time warp mode</a> is used.</p> </dd><dt>Final Phase</dt><dd> <p>This phase begins when the user finalizes the time
offset by calling
<a href="./erlang#system_flag_time_offset">erlang#system_flag_time_offset</a>.
The finalization can only be performed once.</p> <p>During finalization, the time offset is adjusted and
fixed so that current Erlang system time aligns with the
current OS system time. As the time offset can
change during the finalization, Erlang system time
can do a time warp at this point. The time offset is
from now on fixed until the runtime system terminates.
If time correction has been enabled, the time
correction from now on also makes adjustments
to align Erlang system time with OS system
time. When the system is in the final phase, it behaves
exactly as in <a href="#No_Time_Warp_Mode">no time warp mode</a>.</p> </dd></dl><p>In order for this to work properly, the user must ensure
that the following two requirements are satisfied:</p><dl><dt>Forward Time Warp</dt><dd><p>The time warp made when finalizing the time offset
can only be done forwards without encountering problems.
This implies that the user must ensure that OS
system time is set to a time earlier or equal to actual
POSIX time before starting the Erlang runtime system.</p> <p>If you are not sure that OS system time is correct,
set it to a time that is guaranteed to be earlier than
actual POSIX time before starting the Erlang runtime
system, just to be safe.</p> </dd><dt>Finalize Correct OS System Time</dt><dd><p>OS system time must be correct when
the user finalizes the time offset.</p> </dd></dl><p>If these requirements are not fulfilled, the system
may behave very bad.</p><p>Assuming that these requirements are fulfilled,
time correction is enabled, and OS system time
is adjusted using a time adjustment protocol such as NTP,
only small adjustments of Erlang monotonic
time are needed to keep system times
aligned after finalization. As long as the system is not
suspended, the largest adjustments needed are for
inserted (or deleted) leap seconds.</p><div class="alert alert-warning"><h4 class="alert-heading">Warning</h4><p>To use this mode, ensure that
all Erlang code that will execute in both phases is
<a href="#Time_Warp_Safe_Code">time warp safe</a>.</p><p>Code executing only in the final phase does not have
to be able to cope with the time warp.</p></div><a name="Multi_Time_Warp_Mode"></a><h2>Multi-Time Warp Mode</h2><p><em>Multi-time warp mode in combination with time correction is the preferred configuration</em>. This as
the Erlang runtime system have better performance, scale
better, and behave better on almost all platforms.
Also, the accuracy and precision of time measurements
are better. Only Erlang runtime systems executing on
ancient platforms benefit from another configuration.</p><p>The time offset can change at any time without limitations.
That is, Erlang system time can perform time warps both
forwards and backwards at <em>any</em> time. As we align
Erlang system time with OS system time by changing
the time offset, we can enable a time correction that tries
to adjust the frequency of the Erlang monotonic clock to be as
correct as possible. This makes time measurements using
Erlang monotonic time more accurate and precise.</p><p>If time correction is disabled, Erlang monotonic time
leaps forward if OS system time leaps forward. If
OS system time leaps backwards, Erlang monotonic time
stops briefly, but it does not freeze for extended periods
of time. This as the time offset is changed to
align Erlang system time with OS system time.</p><div class="alert alert-warning"><h4 class="alert-heading">Warning</h4><p>To use this mode, ensure that all
Erlang code that will execute on the runtime system is
<a href="#Time_Warp_Safe_Code">time warp safe</a>.</p></div><h2>New Time API</h2><a name="The_New_Time_API"></a><p>The old time API is based on
<a href="./erlang#now/0">erlang#now/0</a>.
<strong>erlang:now/0</strong> was intended to be used for many unrelated
things. This tied these unrelated operations together and
caused issues with performance, scalability, accuracy, and
precision for operations that did not need to have
such issues. To improve this, the new API spreads different
functionality over multiple functions.</p><p>To be backward compatible, <strong>erlang:now/0</strong>
remains "as is", but <em>you are strongly discouraged from using it</em>. Many use cases of <strong>erlang:now/0</strong>
prevents you from using the new
<a href="#Multi_Time_Warp_Mode">multi-time warp mode</a>, which is an important part of this
new time functionality improvement.</p><p>Some of the new BIFs on some systems, perhaps surprisingly,

It is introduced to detach time measurements, such as elapsed
time from calendar time. In many use cases there is a need to
measure elapsed time or specify a time relative to another point
in time without the need to know the involved times in UTC or
any other globally defined time scale. By introducing a time
scale with a local definition of where it starts, time that do
not concern calendar time can be managed on that time
scale. Erlang monotonic time uses such a time scale with a
locally defined start.</p><p>The introduction of Erlang monotonic time allows
us to adjust the two Erlang times (Erlang
monotonic time and Erlang system time) separately. By
doing this, the accuracy of elapsed time does not have to
suffer just because the system time happened to be
wrong at some point in time. Separate adjustments
of the two times are only performed in the time warp
modes, and only fully separated in the
<a href="#Multi_Time_Warp_Mode">multi-time warp mode</a>. All other modes than the
multi-time warp mode are for backward
compatibility reasons. When using these modes, the
accuracy of Erlang monotonic time suffer, as
the adjustments of Erlang monotonic time in these
modes are more or less tied to Erlang system time.</p><p>The adjustment of system time could have been made
smother than using a time warp approach, but we think
that would be a bad choice. As we can
express and measure time that is not connected to
calendar time by the use of Erlang monotonic time, it
is better to expose the change in Erlang system time
immediately. This as the Erlang applications
executing on the system can react on the change in
system time as soon as possible. This is also more or
less exactly how most operating systems handle this
(OS monotonic time and OS system time). By adjusting
system time smoothly, we would just hide the fact that
system time changed and make it harder for the Erlang
applications to react to the change in a sensible way.</p><p>To be able to react to a change in Erlang
system time, you must be able to detect that it
happened. The change in Erlang system time occurs when the
current time offset is changed. We have therefore
introduced the possibility to monitor the time offset using
<a href="./erlang#monitor/2">erlang#monitor/2</a>.
A process monitoring the time
offset is sent a message on the following format
when the time offset is changed:</p><pre><code class="">

Determine the order of events by saving the integer
returned by
<a href="./erlang#unique_integer/1">erlang#unique_integer/1</a>
when the event occurs. These integers are strictly
monotonically ordered on current runtime system instance
corresponding to creation time.

Determine the order of events by saving a time stamp
with <strong>erlang:now/0</strong> when the event occurs.
</p></div><div class="alert alert-success"><h4 class="alert-heading">Do</h4><p>
Determine the order of events by saving a tuple containing
<a href="./erlang#monotonic_time/0">monotonic time</a>
and a <a href="./erlang#unique_integer/1">strictly monotonically increasing integer</a> as follows:</p><pre><code class="">
Time = erlang:monotonic_time(),
UMI = erlang:unique_integer([monotonic]),
EventTag = {Time, UMI}</code></pre><p>These tuples are strictly monotonically ordered
on the current runtime system instance according to
creation time. It is important that the
monotonic time is in the first element (the most
significant element when comparing two-tuples). Using
the monotonic time in the tuples, you can calculate time
between events.</p><p>If you are interested in Erlang system time at the
time when the event occurred, you can also save the time
offset before or after saving the events using
<a href="./erlang#time_offset/0">erlang#time_offset/0</a>.
Erlang monotonic time added with the time
offset corresponds to Erlang system time.</p><p>If you are executing in a mode where time offset
can change, and you want to get the actual
Erlang system time when the event occurred, you can
save the time offset as a third element in the tuple
(the least significant element when comparing three-tuples).</p></div><a name="Dos_and_Donts_Create_a_Unique_Name"></a><h2>Create a Unique Name</h2><div class="alert alert-danger"><h4 class="alert-heading">Don't</h4><p>

</p></div><p>To sum up this section: <em>Do not use erlang:now/0.</em></p><a name="Supporting_Both_New_and_Old_OTP_Releases"></a><h2>Support of Both New and Old OTP Releases</h2><p>It can be required that your code must run on a variety
of OTP installations of different OTP releases. If so, you
cannot use the new API out of the box, as it will
not be available on releases before OTP 18. The solution
is <em>not</em> to avoid using the new API, as your
code would then not benefit from the scalability
and accuracy improvements made. Instead, use the
new API when available, and fall back on <strong>erlang:now/0</strong>
when the new API is unavailable.</p><p>Fortunately most of the new API can easily be
implemented using existing primitives, except for:</p><ul><li> <a href="./erlang#system_info_start_time">erlang#system_info_start_time</a> </li><li> <a href="./erlang#system_info_end_time">erlang#system_info_end_time</a> </li><li> <a href="./erlang#system_info_os_monotonic_time_source">erlang#system_info_os_monotonic_time_source</a> </li><li> <a href="./erlang#system_info_os_system_time_source">erlang#system_info_os_system_time_source</a> </li></ul><p>By wrapping the API with functions that fall back on
<strong>erlang:now/0</strong> when the new API is unavailable,
and using these wrappers instead of using the API directly,
the problem is solved. These wrappers can, for example,
be implemented as in
<a href="time_compat.erl">$ERL_TOP/erts/example/time_compat.erl</a>.</p></body></html>
