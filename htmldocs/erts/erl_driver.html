callback functions that the Erlang Virtual Machine calls when certain
events occur. There can be multiple instances of a driver, each
instance is associated with an Erlang port.<a name="WARNING"></a>As from ERTS 5.5.3 the driver interface has been extended
(see <a href="./driver_entry#extended_marker">driver_entry#extended_marker</a>). The extended interface introduces
<a href="#version_management">version management</a>,
the possibility to pass capability flags (see
<a href="./driver_entry#driver_flags">driver_entry#driver_flags</a>) to the runtime system at driver
initialization, and some new driver API functions.The driver calls back to the emulator, using the API
functions declared in <strong>erl_driver.h</strong>. They are used for
outputting data from the driver, using timers, and so on.Each driver instance is associated with a port. Every port
has a port owner process. Communication with the port is normally
done through the port owner process. Most of the functions take
the <strong>port</strong> handle as an argument. This identifies the driver
instance. Notice that this port handle must be stored by the driver,
it is not given when the driver is called from the emulator (see
<a href="./driver_entry#emulator">driver_entry#emulator</a>).Some of the functions take a parameter of type
<strong>ErlDrvBinary</strong>, a driver binary. It is to be both
allocated and freed by the caller. Using a binary directly avoids
one extra copying of data.Many of the output functions have a "header buffer", with
<strong>hbuf</strong> and <strong>hlen</strong> parameters. This buffer is sent as a
list before the binary (or list, depending on port mode) that is
sent. This is convenient when matching on messages received from
the port. (Although in the latest Erlang versions there is
the binary syntax, which enables you to match on the beginning of
a binary.)<a name="smp_support"></a>In the runtime system with
SMP support, drivers are locked either on driver level
or port level (driver instance level). By default
driver level locking will be used, that is, only one emulator thread
will execute code in the driver at a time. If port level locking
is used, multiple emulator threads can execute code in the driver
at the same time. Only one thread at a time will call
driver callbacks corresponding to the same port, though.
To enable port level locking, set the <strong>ERL_DRV_FLAG_USE_PORT_LOCKING</strong>
<a href="./driver_entry#driver_flags">driver flag</a> in
the <a href="driver_entry">driver_entry</a>
used by the driver. When port level locking is used,
the driver writer is responsible for synchronizing all accesses
to data shared by the ports (driver instances).Most drivers written before the runtime system with SMP
support existed can run in the runtime system
with SMP support, without being rewritten, if driver
level locking is used.Previously, in the runtime system without SMP support,
specific driver callbacks were always called from the same
thread. This is <em>not</em> the case in the runtime system
with SMP support. Regardless of locking scheme used, calls
to driver callbacks can be made from different threads. For example,
two consecutive calls to exactly the same callback for exactly
the same port can be made from two different threads. This
is for <em>most</em> drivers not a problem, but it can be.
Drivers that depend on all callbacks that are called in the
same thread, <em>must</em> be rewritten before they are used
in the runtime system with SMP support.Most functions in this API are <em>not</em> thread-safe, that is,
they <em>cannot</em> be called from arbitrary threads. Functions
that are not documented as thread-safe can only be called from
driver callbacks or function calls descending from a driver
callback call. Notice that driver callbacks can be called from
different threads. This, however, is not a problem for any
function in this API, as the emulator has control over
these threads.<a name="lengthy_work"></a>
As mentioned in the <a href="#WARNING">warning</a> text at
the beginning of this section, it is of vital importance that a driver
callback returns relatively fast. It is difficult to give an exact
maximum amount of time that a driver callback is allowed to work, but
usually a well-behaving driver callback is to return within 1 millisecond.
This can be achieved using different approaches.
If you have full control over the code to execute in the driver
callback, the best approach is to divide the work into multiple chunks of
work, and trigger multiple calls to the
<a href="./driver_entry#timeout">time-out callback</a> using
zero time-outs. Function <a href="#erl_drv_consume_timeslice">erl_drv_consume_timeslice</a> can be useful to
determine when to trigger such time-out callback calls. However, sometimes
it cannot be implemented this way, for example when calling
third-party libraries. In this case, you typically want to dispatch the
work to another thread. Information about thread primitives is provided
below.</p><h2>Functionality</h2><p>All functions that a driver needs to do with Erlang are
performed through driver API functions. Functions exist
for the following functionality:</p><dl><dt>Timer functions</dt><dd> <p>Control the timer that a driver can use. The timer has the
emulator call the <a href="./driver_entry#timeout">driver_entry#timeout</a> entry function after a specified time.
Only one timer is available for each driver instance.</p> </dd><dt>Queue handling</dt><dd> <p>Every driver instance has an associated queue. This queue is a
<strong>SysIOVec</strong>, which works as a buffer. It is mostly used for
the driver to buffer data that is to be written to a device,
it is a byte stream. If the port owner process closes the
driver, and the queue is not empty, the driver is not
closed. This enables the driver to flush its buffers before
closing.</p> <p>The queue can be manipulated from any threads if
a port data lock is used. For more information, see
<a href="#ErlDrvPDL">ErlDrvPDL</a>.</p> </dd><dt>Output functions</dt><dd> <p>With these functions, the driver sends data back to the emulator.
The data is received as messages by the port owner process, see
<a href="./erlang#open_port/2">erlang#open_port/2</a>. The vector function and the
function taking a driver binary are faster, as they avoid
copying the data buffer. There is also a fast way of sending
terms from the driver, without going through the binary term
format.</p></dd><dt>Failure</dt><dd> <p>The driver can exit and signal errors up to Erlang. This is
only for severe errors, when the driver cannot possibly keep
open.</p> </dd><dt>Asynchronous calls</dt><dd> <p>Erlang/OTP R7B and later versions have provision for
asynchronous function calls, using a thread pool provided by
Erlang. There is also a select call, which can be used for
asynchronous drivers.</p> </dd><dt><a name="multi_threading"></a>Multi-threading</dt><dd> <p>A POSIX thread like API for multi-threading is provided. The
Erlang driver thread API only provides a subset of the functionality
provided by the POSIX thread API. The subset provided is
more or less the basic functionality needed for multi-threaded
programming:</p> <ul><li><a href="#ErlDrvTid">Threads</a></li><li><a href="#ErlDrvMutex">Mutexes</a></li><li><a href="#ErlDrvCond"> Condition variables</a></li><li><a href="#ErlDrvRWLock"> Read/write locks</a></li><li><a href="#ErlDrvTSDKey"> Thread-specific data</a></li></ul> <p>The Erlang driver thread API can be used in conjunction with
the POSIX thread API on UN-ices and with the Windows native thread
API on Windows. The Erlang driver thread API has the advantage of
being portable, but there can exist situations where you want to
use functionality from the POSIX thread API or the Windows
native thread API.</p> <p>The Erlang driver thread API only returns error codes when it is
reasonable to recover from an error condition. If it is not reasonable
to recover from an error condition, the whole runtime system is
terminated. For example, if a create mutex operation fails, an error
code is returned, but if a lock operation on a mutex fails, the
whole runtime system is terminated.</p> <p>Notice that there is no "condition variable wait with time-out" in
the Erlang driver thread API. This because of issues with
<strong>pthread_cond_timedwait</strong>. When the system clock suddenly
is changed, it is not always guaranteed that you will wake up from
the call as expected. An Erlang runtime system must be able to
cope with sudden changes of the system clock. Therefore, we have
omitted it from the Erlang driver thread API. In the Erlang driver
case, time-outs can and are to be handled with the timer functionality
of the Erlang driver API.</p> <p>In order for the Erlang driver thread API to function, thread
support must be enabled in the runtime system. An Erlang driver
can check if thread support is enabled by use of
<a href="#driver_system_info">driver_system_info</a>.
Notice that some functions in the Erlang driver API are thread-safe
only when the runtime system has SMP support, also this
information can be retrieved through
<a href="#driver_system_info">driver_system_info</a>.
Also notice that many functions in the Erlang driver API are
<em>not</em> thread-safe, regardless of whether SMP support is
enabled or not. If a function is not documented as thread-safe, it
is <em>not</em> thread-safe.</p> <div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>When executing in an emulator thread, it is
<em>very important</em> that you unlock <em>all</em> locks you
have locked before letting the thread out of your control;
otherwise you are <em>very likely</em> to deadlock the whole
emulator.</p><p>If you need to use thread-specific data in an emulator
thread, only have the thread-specific data set while the thread is
under your control, and clear the thread-specific data before
you let the thread out of your control.</p></div> <p>In the future, debug functionality will probably be
integrated with the Erlang driver thread API. All functions
that create entities take a <strong>name</strong> argument. Currently
the <strong>name</strong> argument is unused, but it will be used when
the debug functionality is implemented. If you name all
entities created well, the debug functionality will be able
to give you better error reports.</p> </dd><dt>Adding/removing drivers</dt><dd> <p>A driver can add and later remove drivers.</p> </dd><dt>Monitoring processes</dt><dd> <p>A driver can monitor a process that does not own a port.</p> </dd><dt><a name="version_management"></a>Version management</dt><dd> <p>Version management is enabled for drivers that have set the
<a href="./driver_entry#extended_marker">driver_entry#extended_marker</a> field of their
<a href="driver_entry">driver_entry</a>
to <strong>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MARKER</strong>. <strong>erl_driver.h</strong> defines:</p> <ul><li> <p><strong>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MARKER</strong></p> </li><li> <p><strong>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MAJOR_VERSION</strong>, which is incremented when
driver incompatible changes are made to the Erlang runtime
system. Normally it suffices to recompile drivers when
<strong>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MAJOR_VERSION</strong> has changed, but it
can, under rare circumstances, mean that drivers must
be slightly modified. If so, this will of course be
documented.</p> </li><li> <p><strong>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MINOR_VERSION</strong>, which is incremented when
new features are added. The runtime system uses the minor version
of the driver to determine what features to use.</p> </li></ul> <p>The runtime system normally refuses to load a driver if the major
versions differ, or if the major versions are equal and the
minor version used by the driver is greater than the one used
by the runtime system. Old drivers with lower major versions
are however allowed after a bump of the major version during
a transition period of two major releases. Such old drivers can,
however, fail if deprecated features are used.</p> <p>The emulator refuses to load a driver that does not use
the extended driver interface, to allow for 64-bit capable drivers,
as incompatible type changes for the callbacks
<a href="./driver_entry#output">driver_entry#output</a>,
<a href="./driver_entry#control">driver_entry#control</a>, and
<a href="./driver_entry#call">driver_entry#call</a>
were introduced in Erlang/OTP R15B. A driver written
with the old types would compile with warnings and when
called return garbage sizes to the emulator, causing it
to read random memory and create huge incorrect result blobs.</p> <p>Therefore it is not enough to only recompile drivers written with
version management for pre R15B types; the types must be changed
in the driver suggesting other rewrites, especially regarding size
variables. <em>Investigate all warnings when recompiling.</em></p> <p>Also, the API driver functions <strong>driver_output*</strong> and
<strong>driver_vec_to_buf</strong>, <strong>driver_alloc/realloc*</strong>, and the
<strong>driver_*</strong> queue functions were changed to have
larger length arguments and return values. This is a
lesser problem, as code that passes smaller types
gets them auto-converted in the calls, and as long as
the driver does not handle sizes that overflow an <strong>int</strong>,
all will work as before.</p> </dd><dt><a name="time_measurement"></a>Time measurement</dt><dd> <p>Support for time measurement in drivers:</p> <ul><li><a href="#ErlDrvTime">ErlDrvTime</a></li><li><a href="#ErlDrvTimeUnit">ErlDrvTimeUnit</a></li><li><a href="#erl_drv_monotonic_time">erl_drv_monotonic_time</a></li><li><a href="#erl_drv_time_offset">erl_drv_time_offset</a></li><li><a href="#erl_drv_convert_time_unit">erl_drv_convert_time_unit</a></li></ul> </dd></dl><a name="rewrites_for_64_bits"></a><h2>Rewrites for 64-Bit Driver Interface</h2><p>ERTS 5.9 introduced two new integer types,

<a href="#ErlDrvSSizeT">ErlDrvSSizeT</a>,
which can hold 64-bit sizes if necessary.</p><p>To not update a driver and only recompile, it probably works
when building for a 32-bit machine creating a false sense of security.
Hopefully that will generate many important warnings.
But when recompiling the same driver later on for a 64-bit machine,
there <em>will</em> be warnings and almost certainly crashes.
So it is a <em>bad</em> idea to postpone updating the driver and
not fixing the warnings.</p><p>When recompiling with <strong>gcc</strong>, use flag <strong>-Wstrict-prototypes</strong>
to get better warnings. Try to find a similar flag if you use
another compiler.</p><p>The following is a checklist for rewriting a pre ERTS 5.9 driver,

bytes, either crashing on memory allocation or succeeding with
a random result from the driver call.</p></div> </dd><dt>Arguments to driver callbacks</dt><dd> <p>Driver callback

This means that calling <strong>driver_free_binary</strong>, it may not
actually dispose of it. If it is sent to the emulator, it can

<strong>async_invoke</strong> is invoked in a thread separate from the

<a href="./erl#async_thread_pool_size">erl#async_thread_pool_size</a>

If an async thread pool is unavailable, the call is made

retrieved through <a href="#driver_system_info">driver_system_info</a>.</p><p>If a thread pool is available, a thread is used.
If argument <strong>key</strong> is <strong>NULL</strong>, the threads from the
pool are used in a round-robin way, each call to
<strong>driver_async</strong> uses the next thread in the pool. With
argument <strong>key</strong> set, this behavior is changed. The two
same values of <strong>*key</strong> always get the same thread.</p><p>To ensure that a driver instance always uses the same
thread, the following call can be used:</p><pre><code class="">
unsigned int myKey = driver_async_port_key(myPort);

r = driver_async(myPort, &amp;myKey, myData, myFunc);    </code></pre><p>It is enough to initialize <strong>myKey</strong> once for each

queued up and executed in order. Using the same thread for
each driver instance ensures that the calls are made in sequence.</p><p>The <strong>async_data</strong> is the argument to the functions

pointer to a structure containing a pipe or event that
can be used to signal that the async operation completed.
The data is to be freed in <strong>async_free</strong>.</p><p>When the async operation is done,

events to check for. This enables the emulator to call the driver
when something has occurred asynchronously.</p><p>Parameter <strong>event</strong> identifies an OS-specific event object.
On Unix systems, the functions <strong>select</strong>/<strong>poll</strong> are used.
The event object must be a socket or pipe (or other object that
<strong>select</strong>/<strong>poll</strong> can use).
On Windows, the Win32 API function <strong>WaitForMultipleObjects</strong>
is used. This places other restrictions on the event object;
see the Win32 SDK documentation.</p><p>Parameter <strong>on</strong> is to be <strong>1</strong> for setting events
and <strong>0</strong> for clearing them.</p><p>Parameter <strong>mode</strong> is a bitwise OR combination of
<strong>ERL_DRV_READ</strong>, <strong>ERL_DRV_WRITE</strong>, and <strong>ERL_DRV_USE</strong>.
The first two specify whether to wait for read events and/or write
events. A fired read event calls
<a href="./driver_entry#ready_input">driver_entry#ready_input</a> and a fired write event calls
<a href="./driver_entry#ready_output">driver_entry#ready_output</a>.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>Some OS (Windows) do not differentiate between read and write
events. The callback for a fired event then only depends on the
value of <strong>mode</strong>.</p></div><p><strong>ERL_DRV_USE</strong> specifies if we are using the event object or
if we want to close it.
On an emulator with SMP support, it is not safe to clear all events
and then close the event object after <strong>driver_select</strong> has
returned. Another thread can still be using the event object
internally. To safely close an event object, call
<strong>driver_select</strong> with <strong>ERL_DRV_USE</strong> and <strong>on==0</strong>, which
clears all events and then either calls
<a href="./driver_entry#stop_select">driver_entry#stop_select</a>
or schedules it to be called when it is safe to close the event
object. <strong>ERL_DRV_USE</strong> is to be set together with the first event
for an event object. It is harmless to set <strong>ERL_DRV_USE</strong>
even if it already has been done. Clearing all events but keeping
<strong>ERL_DRV_USE</strong> set indicates that we are using the event
object and probably will set events for it again.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p><strong>ERL_DRV_USE</strong> was added in Erlang/OTP R13. Old drivers still
work as before, but it is recommended to update them to use

busy state of the port message queue.</p><p>The port message queue is set into a busy
state when the amount of command data queued on the
message queue reaches the <strong>high</strong> limit. The port
message queue is set into a not busy state when the
amount of command data queued on the message queue falls
below the <strong>low</strong> limit. Command data is in this
context data passed to the port using either
<strong>Port ! {Owner, {command, Data}}</strong> or
<strong>port_command/[2,3]</strong>. Notice that these limits
only concerns command data that have not yet reached the
port. The <a href="#set_busy_port">busy port</a>
feature can be used for data that has reached the port.</p><p>Valid limits are values in the range
<strong>[ERL_DRV_BUSY_MSGQ_LIM_MIN, ERL_DRV_BUSY_MSGQ_LIM_MAX]</strong>.
Limits are automatically adjusted to be sane. That is,
the system adjusts values so that the low limit used is
lower than or equal to the high limit used. By default the high
limit is 8 kB and the low limit is 4 kB.</p><p>By passing a pointer to an integer variable containing
the value <strong>ERL_DRV_BUSY_MSGQ_READ_ONLY</strong>, the currently used
limit is read and written back to the integer variable.
A new limit can be set by passing a pointer to an integer
variable containing a valid limit. The passed value is
written to the internal limit. The internal limit is then
adjusted. After this the adjusted limit is written
back to the integer variable from which the new value was
read. Values are in bytes.</p><p>The busy message queue feature can be disabled either
by setting the <strong>ERL_DRV_FLAG_NO_BUSY_MSGQ</strong>
<a href="./driver_entry#driver_flags">driver flag</a>
