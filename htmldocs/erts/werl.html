use is as follows:<strong>werl &lt;arguments&gt;</strong>This starts Erlang in its own window, with fully
functioning command-line editing and scrollbars. All flags
except <strong>-oldshell</strong> work as they do for
<a href="erl">erl</a>.<ul><li> <p>To copy text to the clipboard, use <strong>Ctrl-C</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p>To paste text, use <strong>Ctrl-V</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p>To interrupt the runtime system or the shell process (depending
on what has been specified with system flag <strong>+B</strong>), use
<strong>Ctrl-Break</strong>.</p> </li></ul>In cases where you want to redirect standard input and/or
standard output or use Erlang in a pipeline, <strong>werl</strong> is
not suitable, and the <strong>erl</strong> program is to be used instead.The <strong>werl</strong> window is in many ways modeled after the <strong>xterm</strong>
window present on other platforms, as the <strong>xterm</strong> model
fits well with line-oriented command-based interaction. This
means that selecting text is line-oriented rather than
rectangle-oriented.<ul><li> <p>To select text in the <strong>werl</strong> window, press and hold
the left mouse button and drag the mouse over the text you want
to select. If the selection crosses line boundaries, the
selected text consists of complete lines where applicable
(just like in a word processor).</p> </li><li> <p>To select more text than fits
in the window, start by selecting a small part in the
beginning of the text you want, then use the scrollbar
to view the end of the desired selection, point to it, and press
the <em>right</em> mouse button. The whole area between your
first selection and the point where you right-clicked is
included in the selection.</p> </li><li> <p>To copy the selected text to the clipboard, either
use <strong>Ctrl-C</strong>, use the menu, or press the copy
button in the toolbar.</p> </li></ul>Pasted text is inserted at the current prompt position
and is interpreted by Erlang as usual keyboard input.<ul><li> <p>To retrieve previous command lines, press the <strong>Up arrow</strong> or
use <strong>Ctrl-P</strong>.</p> </li></ul>A drop-down box in the toolbar contains the command
history. Selecting a command in the drop-down box inserts the command
at the prompt, as if you used the keyboard to retrieve the
command.<ul><li> <p>To stop the Erlang emulator, close the <strong>werl</strong> window.</p> </li></ul></p></body></html>
