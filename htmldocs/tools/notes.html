Own Id: OTP-14344</p> </li><li> <p>
In fprof when sampling multiple processes and analyzing
with totals set to true, the output now sums together all
caller and callee entries which concerns the same
function. Previous behaviour was to report each

In OTP-20.0, the behavior of c, make, and ct_make was
changed so that in some cases the beam files by default
would be written to the directory where the source files
were found. This is now changed back to the old behavior
so beam files are by default written to current
directory.</p> <p>

Various emacs mode improvements, such as better tags
support.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-13610</p> </li></ul><h2>Tools 2.8.3</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
<strong>cover:compile_beam/1</strong> and
<strong>cover:compile_beam_directory/1,2</strong> crashed when
trying to compile a beam file without a <strong>'file'</strong>
attribute. This has been corrected and an error is
returned instead.</p> <p>
Thanks to Louis-Philippe Gauthier for reporting this bug.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-13200</p> </li><li> <p>Fix a bit string comprehension bug in Cover. </p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-13277 Aux Id: PR 856 </p> </li></ul><h2>Tools 2.8.2</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
The emacs mode does not add a newline after the arrow on
-callback lines anymore.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-13042</p> </li></ul><h2>Tools 2.8.1</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
If a module includes eunit.hrl, a parse transform adds
the function test/0 on line 0 in the module. A bug in
OTP-18.0 caused cover:analyse_to_file/1 to fail to insert
cover data in the output file when line 0 existed in the
cover data table. This is now corrected.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-12981</p> </li></ul><h2>Tools 2.8</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
In order to improve performance of the cover tool, new
functions are added for cover compilation and analysis on
multiple files. This allows for more parallelisation.</p> <p>
Some improvements of the data base access is also done in
order to improve the performance when analysing and
resetting cover data.</p> <p>
Minor incompatibility: An error reason from
analyse_to_file is changed from no_source_code_found to
{no_source_code_found,Module}.</p> <p>
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-12330 Aux Id: seq12757 </p> </li><li> <p>Attempting to do a <strong>cover</strong> analysis when neither
source code nor beam file could be found would hang the

error.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-12806</p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>
Allow maps for supervisor flags and child specs</p> <p>
Earlier, supervisor flags and child specs were given as
tuples. While this is kept for backwards compatibility,
it is now also allowed to give these parameters as maps,
see <a href="../stdlib/supervisor#sup_flags">sup_flags</a>
and <a href="../stdlib/supervisor#child_spec">child_spec</a>.</p> <p>

Own Id: OTP-11764</p> </li></ul><h2>Tools 2.6.13</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
Erlang-specific compilation error regexp is added in
erlang-eunit.el. This defvar was earlier in erlang.el,

Make the Emacs Erlang mode TRAMP-aware when compiling.
Thanks to Tomas Abrahamsson.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-11270</p> </li></ul><h2>Tools 2.6.11</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
When cover:stop(Node) was called on a non-existing node,
a process waiting for cover data from the node would hang
forever. This has been corrected.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-10979</p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>
Make cover smarter about finding source from beam.</p> <p>
In particular, search using the source path in

The BIF highlighting in the emacs mode has been updated
to correspond with the correct BIFs.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-10774</p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p> Support for Unicode has been implemented. </p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-10302</p> </li><li> <p>
A new function, cover:flush(Nodes), is added which will
fetch data from remote nodes without stopping cover on
those nodes. This is used by test_server and common_test
when it is safe to assume that the node will be
terminated after the test anyway. The purpose is to avoid
processes crashing when re-loading the original beam if
the processes is still running old code.</p> <p>
Remote nodes will now continue to count code coverage if
the connection to the main node is broken. Earlier, a
broken connection would cause the cover_server on the
remote node to die and thus any still cover compiled
modules would cause process crash when trying to insert
cover data in ets tables that used to exist on the
cover_server. The new functionality also involves
synchronization with the main node if the nodes are
reconnected.</p> <p>
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-10523 Aux Id: OTP-10427 </p> </li><li> <p>Where necessary a comment stating encoding has been
added to Erlang files. The comment is meant to be removed
in Erlang/OTP R17B when UTF-8 becomes the default
encoding. </p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-10630</p> </li><li> <p>
Fix syntax highlighting of $\' in Emacs mode. Thanks to
Magnus Henoch.</p> <p>

Documentation fixes (Thanks to Ricardo Catalinas JimÃ©nez
)</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-10121</p> </li><li> <p>
Remove Erlang-specific compilation error regexp in
erlang.el</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-10168</p> </li><li> <p>
Fix highlighting of atoms ending with a dollar sign</p> <p>
Like this: 'atom$'. In that example, the last single
quote should be recognised as ending the atom. This needs
a font-lock workaround similar to the one for strings.
Thanks to Magnus Henoch</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-10178</p> </li><li> <p> Xref now accepts filenames with character codes
greater than 126. (Thanks to Emile Joubert for reporting
the issue.) </p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-10192</p> </li><li> <p>
Add test_indentation target to lib/tools/emacs/Makefile</p> <p>
Automatically indent test.erl.orig, save to test.erl, and
compare to test.erl.intended. Thanks to Magnus Henoch.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-10226</p> </li></ul><h2>Tools 2.6.7</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
Makefiles in erts, hipe and tools have been corrected to
enable parallel make, i.e MAKEFLAGS=-jX where X is the
parallelity number. As a result of this dependencies were
corrected since that is what is needed for parallel make
to work.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-9857 Aux Id: OTP-9451 </p> </li><li> <p>Minor suppressions and fixes of compilation
warnings</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-10016</p> </li></ul><h2>Tools 2.6.6.6</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>Update system profiling principles to reflect eprof
performance improvements.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-9656</p> </li><li> <p>
[cover] fix leftover {'DOWN', ..} msg in callers queue</p> <p>
After stopping cover with cover:stop() there could still
be a {'DOWN',...} leftover message in the calling
process's message queue. This unexpected leftover could
be eliminated if erlang:demonitor/2 with option flush
would be used in certain points</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-9694</p> </li><li> <p>
Add deps as erlang-flymake include directory.</p> <p>
Update erlang-flymake to recognize the "deps" folder as
an include directory. This makes erlang-flymake
compatible with the rebar dependency management tool's
default folder structure, which puts included
dependencies in "deps".(Thanks to Kevin Albrecht)</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-9791</p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>Variables are now now allowed in '<strong>fun M:F/A</strong>' as
suggested by Richard O'Keefe in EEP-23.</p> <p>The representation of '<strong>fun M:F/A</strong>' in the
abstract format has been changed in an incompatible way.
Tools that directly read or manipulate the abstract
format (such as parse transforms) may need to be updated.
The compiler can handle both the new and the old format
(i.e. extracting the abstract format from a pre-R15 BEAM
file and compiling it using compile:forms/1,2 will work).
The <strong>syntax_tools</strong> application can also handle both
formats.</p> <p>
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-9643</p> </li><li> <p>
Tuple funs (a two-element tuple with a module name and a
function) are now officially deprecated and will be
removed in R16. Use '<strong>fun M:F/A</strong>' instead. To make
you aware that your system uses tuple funs, the very
first time a tuple fun is applied, a warning will be sent
to the error logger.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-9649</p> </li><li> <p>
Eliminate use of deprecated regexp module</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-9810</p> </li></ul><h2>Tools 2.6.6.5</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
Teach the emacs mode to compile yecc and leex files</p> <p>
If visiting a .yrl or .xrl file in emacs with
erlang-mode, then the `erlang-compile' function (normally
bound to C-c C-k), now knows how to compile yecc and leex
files, and then, if that compilation succeeds, also
compiles the resulting .erl files.</p> <p>
Also introduce a `erlang-compile-command-function-alist'
to make it possible to hook in other functions for
computing compilation commands/expressions, depending on
file name. (Thanks to Tomas Abrahamsson )</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-9503</p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p> Bugs in xref(3) have been fixed. (Thanks to Matthias
Lang.) </p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-9416</p> </li></ul><h2>Tools 2.6.6.4</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
Change make:files to behave more like erlc</p> <p>
This change removes the unnecessary checks on the files
when make:files is called and allows the error checking
to be done in compile:file, where the error messages are
produced. It does not affect the return value.</p> <p>
(Thanks to Sam bobroff)</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-9179</p> </li><li> <p>
add user specified compiler options on form reloading</p> <p>
In order to be able to test non-exported functions from
another (test) module it is necessary to compile the
specific module (at least during the test phase) with the
export_all compiler option. This allows complete
separation of testing and productive code. At the moment
it is not possible to combine this with a test code
coverage using the cover module. The problem is that when
cover compiling a module using cover:compile_* the code
is reloaded into the emulator omitting/filtering the
passed user options. In my example above the export_all
option would be removed and the non-exported functions
cannot be called any more. (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-9204</p> </li><li> <p>
Inhibit electric newline after "-&gt;" when inside a type
spec</p> <p>
The Erlang mode for Emacs inserts a newline after every
"-&gt;", which saves you one keystroke when writing a
function, but that is inappropriate when writing a type
spec, as you'd normally keep the spec on one line. This
change inhibits the automatic insertion when the current
line starts with "-spec" or "-type".(Thanks to Magnus
Henoch)</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-9255</p> </li><li> <p>

Declare indentation options as "safe" in erlang-mode for
Emacs</p> <p>
Emacs has a facility for setting options on a per-file
basis based on comments in the source file. By default,
all options are considered "unsafe", and the user is
queried before the variable is set. This patch declares
the variables erlang-indent-level, erlang-indent-guard
and erlang-argument-indent to be safe, if the value
specified in the source file is valid.</p> <p>
Such declarations usually look like this:</p> <p>
%% -*- erlang-indent-level: 2 -*-</p> <p>
and appear on the first line of the file. (thanks to
Magnus Henoch)</p> <p>

Cover has been improved to take less memory and allow
parallel analysis of cover data. Data collection from
nodes is now done in parallel and it is now possible to
issue multiple analyse and analyse_to_file requests at
the same time. A new function call async_analyse_to_file
has also been introduced, see the documentation for more
details.</p> <p>

The Lock profiling tool, lcnt, can make use of the

This provides a mechanism to examine potential lock
bottlenecks within the runtime itself.</p> <p>
- Add erts_debug:lock_counters({copy_save, bool()}). This
option enables or disables statistics saving for
destroyed processes and ets-tables. Enabling this might
consume a lot of memory.</p> <p>
