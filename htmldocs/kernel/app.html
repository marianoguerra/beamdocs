application uses, and how the application is started. There must
always be one application resource file called

the system.The file is read by the application controller when an
application is loaded/started. It is also used by the functions in
<strong>systools</strong>, for example when generating start scripts.</p><h2>File Syntax</h2><p>The application resource file is to be called

application name. The file is to be located in directory <strong>ebin</strong>

When this application is started, all included applications
are loaded automatically, but not started, by
the application controller. It is assumed that the top-most

this list to generate correct start scripts. Defaults to
the empty list, but notice that all applications have
dependencies to (at least) Kernel and STDLIB.</p> </dd><dt><strong>env</strong></dt><dd> <p>Configuration parameters used by the application. The value
of a configuration parameter is retrieved by calling
<strong>application:get_env/1,2</strong>. The values in the application

file (see <a href="config">config</a>)

<a href="application">application</a>.</p> <p>Key <strong>mod</strong> is necessary for an application
implemented as a supervision tree, otherwise the application
controller does not know how to start it. <strong>mod</strong>
can be omitted for applications without processes, typically
code libraries, for example, STDLIB.</p> </dd><dt><strong>start_phases</strong></dt><dd> <p>A list of start phases and corresponding start arguments for
the application. If this key is present, the application
master, in addition to the usual call to
<strong>Module:start/2</strong>, also calls
<strong>Module:start_phase(Phase,Type,PhaseArgs)</strong> for each
start phase defined by key <strong>start_phases</strong>. Only
after this extended start procedure,
<strong>application:start(Application)</strong> returns.</p> <p>Start phases can be used to synchronize startup of an
application and its included applications. In this case,
key <strong>mod</strong> must be specified as follows:</p> <pre><code class="">
{mod, {application_starter,[Module,StartArgs]}}</code></pre> <p>The application master then calls <strong>Module:start/2</strong>
for the primary application, followed by calls to
<strong>Module:start_phase/3</strong> for each start phase (as defined
for the primary application), both for the primary application
and for each of its included applications, for which the start
phase is defined.</p> <p>This implies that for an included application, the set of
start phases must be a subset of the set of phases defined
for the primary application. For more information, see
<a href="./applications">OTP Design Principles</a>.
</p> </dd><dt> <a name="runtime_dependencies"></a> <strong>runtime_dependencies</strong></dt><dd> <p>A list of application versions that the application
depends on. An example of such an application version is
<strong>"kernel-3.0"</strong>. Application versions specified as runtime
dependencies are minimum requirements. That is, a larger
application version than the one specified in the
dependency satisfies the requirement. For information about
how to compare application versions, see section
<a href="./versions">Versions</a>
in the System Principles User's Guide.</p> <p>Notice that the application version
specifies a source code version. One more, indirect,
requirement is that the installed binary application of
the specified version is built so that it is
compatible with the rest of the system.</p> <p>Some dependencies can only be required in specific runtime
scenarios. When such optional dependencies exist, these are
specified and documented in the corresponding "App" documentation
of the specific application.</p> <div class="alert alert-warning"><h4 class="alert-heading">Warning</h4><p>The <strong>runtime_dependencies</strong> key was introduced in
OTP 17.0. The type of its value might be subject to changes during
