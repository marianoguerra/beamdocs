Each message can be sent
to one, some, or all group members.A group of processes can be accessed by a common name. For
example, if there is a group named <strong>foobar</strong>, there can be a
set of processes (which can be located on different nodes) that
are all members of the group <strong>foobar</strong>. There are no special
functions for sending a message to the group. Instead, client
functions are to be written with the functions
<a href="#get_members/1">get_members/1</a> and
<a href="#get_local_members/1">get_local_members/1</a>
to determine which processes are members of the group.
Then the message can be sent to one or more group members.If a member terminates, it is automatically removed from the group.</p><h1>Data Types</h1><span class="name">name</span><p>The name of a process group.</p><h1>Functions</h1><h2>create/1</h2><p>Create a new, empty process group.</p><p>Creates a new, empty process group. The group is globally
visible on all nodes. If the group exists, nothing happens.</p><h2>delete/1</h2><p>Delete a process group.</p><p>Deletes a process group.</p><h2>get_closest_pid/1</h2><p>Common dispatch function.</p><p>A useful dispatch function that can be used from
client functions. It returns a process on the local node, if
such a process exists. Otherwise, it selects one randomly.</p><h2>get_local_members/1</h2><p>Return all local processes in a group.</p><p>Returns all processes running on the local node in the
group <strong>Name</strong>. This function is to be used from
within a client function that accesses the group. It is therefore
optimized for speed.</p><h2>get_members/1</h2><p>Return all processes in a group.</p><p>Returns all processes in the group <strong>Name</strong>. This
function is to be used from within a client function that
accesses the group. It is therefore optimized for speed.</p><h2>join/2</h2><p>Join a process to a group.</p><p>Joins the process <strong>Pid</strong> to the group <strong>Name</strong>.
A process can join a group many times and must then
leave the group the same number of times.</p><h2>leave/2</h2><p>Make a process leave a group.</p><p>Makes the process <strong>Pid</strong> leave the group <strong>Name</strong>.
If the process is not a member of the group, <strong>ok</strong> is
returned.</p><h2>start/0</h2><h2>start_link/0</h2><p>Start the <strong>pg2</strong> server.</p><p>Starts the <strong>pg2</strong> server. Normally, the server does not need
to be started explicitly, as it is started dynamically if it
is needed. This is useful during development, but in a
target system the server is to be started explicitly. Use the
configuration parameters for
<a href="./kernel_app#start_pg2">kernel_app#start_pg2</a>
for this.</p><h2>which_groups/0</h2><p>Return a list of all known groups.</p><p>Returns a list of all known groups.</p><h2>See Also</h2><p><a href="kernel_app">kernel_app</a></p></body></html>
