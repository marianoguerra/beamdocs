and unloading <em>Erlang linked-in drivers</em> in runtime.The driver is to be provided as a dynamically linked library
in an object code format specific for the platform in use,
that is, <strong>.so</strong> files on most Unix systems and <strong>.ddl</strong>
files on Windows. An Erlang linked-in driver must provide
specific interfaces to the emulator, so this module is not
designed for loading arbitrary dynamic libraries. For more
information about Erlang drivers, see
<a href="./erl_driver">erts/erl_driver</a>
.<a name="users"></a>When describing a set of functions (that is, a module, a part of a
module, or an application), executing in a process and wanting to
use a ddll-driver, we use the term <em>user</em>. A process can
have many users (different modules needing the same
driver) and many processes running the same code, making up
many <em>users</em> of a driver.In the basic scenario, each user loads the driver before
starting to use it and unloads the driver when done.
The reference counting keeps track of
processes and the number of loads by each process. This way
the driver is only unloaded when no one wants it (it has no user).
The driver also keeps track of ports that are
opened to it. This enables delay of unloading until all
ports are closed, or killing of all ports that use the driver when
it is unloaded.<a name="scenarios"></a>The interface supports two basic scenarios of loading and
unloading. Each scenario can also have the option of either
killing ports when the driver is unloading, or waiting for the
ports to close themselves. The scenarios are as follows:<dl><dt><em>Load and Unload on a "When Needed Basis"</em></dt><dd> <p>This (most common) scenario simply supports that each
<a href="#users">user</a> of the driver loads
it when needed and unloads it when no longer needed.
The driver is always reference counted and as long as a
process keeping the driver loaded is still alive, the driver
is present in the system.</p> <p>Each <a href="#users">user</a> of the driver
use <em>literally</em> the same pathname for the driver when
demanding load, but the
<a href="#users">users</a> are not concerned
with if the driver is already loaded from the file system or
if the object code must be loaded from file system.</p> <p>The following two pairs of functions support this scenario:</p> <dl><dt><em>load/2 and unload/1</em></dt><dd> <p>When using the <strong>load/unload</strong> interfaces, the
driver is not unloaded until the
<em>last port</em> using the driver is closed. Function
<strong>unload/1</strong> can return immediately, as the
<a href="#users">users</a>
have no interrest in when the unloading occurs. The
driver is unloaded when no one needs it any longer.</p> <p>If a process having the driver loaded dies, it has
the same effect as if unloading is done.</p> <p>When loading, function <strong>load/2</strong> returns
<strong>ok</strong> when any instance of the driver is
present. Thus, if a driver is waiting to get unloaded
(because of open ports), it simply changes state to no
longer need unloading.</p> </dd><dt><em>load_driver/2 and unload_driver/1</em></dt><dd> <p>These interfaces are intended to be used when it is considered an
error that ports are open to a driver that no
<a href="#users">user</a>
has loaded. The ports that are still open when the
last <a href="#users">user</a> calls
<strong>unload_driver/1</strong> or when the last process having the
driver loaded dies, are killed with reason
<strong>driver_unloaded</strong>.</p> <p>The function names <strong>load_driver</strong> and
<strong>unload_driver</strong> are kept for backward
compatibility.</p> </dd></dl> </dd><dt><em>Loading and Reloading for Code Replacement</em></dt><dd> <p>This scenario can occur if the driver code needs
replacement during operation of the Erlang
emulator. Implementing driver code replacement is a little
more tedious than Beam code replacement, as one driver
cannot be loaded as both "old" and "new" code. All
<a href="#users">users</a> of a driver must have it
closed (no open ports) before the old code can be unloaded
and the new code can be loaded.</p> <p>The unloading/loading is done as one atomic
operation, blocking all processes in the system from using
the driver in question while in progress.</p> <p>The preferred way to do driver code replacement is to let
<em>one single process</em> keep track of the driver. When
the process starts, the driver is loaded. When replacement
is required, the driver is reloaded. Unload is probably never
done, or done when the process exits. If more than one
<a href="#users">user</a> has a driver
loaded when code replacement is demanded, the replacement cannot
occur until the last "other"
<a href="#users">user</a> has
unloaded the driver.</p> <p>Demanding reload when a reload is already in progress is
always an error. Using the high-level functions, it is also
an error to demand reloading when more than one
<a href="#users">user</a> has the driver loaded.</p> <p>To simplify driver replacement, avoid designing your system so
that more than one
<a href="#users">user</a> has the driver loaded.</p> <p>The two functions for reloading drivers are to be used
together with corresponding load functions to support the two
different behaviors concerning open ports:</p> <dl><dt><em>load/2 and reload/2</em></dt><dd> <p>This pair of functions is used when reloading is to be
done after the last open port to the driver is
closed.</p> <p>As <strong>reload/2</strong> waits for the reloading to
occur, a misbehaving process keeping open ports to
the driver (or keeping the driver loaded) can cause
infinite waiting for reload. Time-outs must be provided
outside of the process demanding the reload or by using
the low-level interface
<a href="#try_load/3">try_load/3</a>
in combination with driver monitors.</p> </dd><dt><em>load_driver/2 and reload_driver/2</em></dt><dd> <p>This pair of functions are used when open ports to
the driver are to be killed with reason
<strong>driver_unloaded</strong> to allow for new driver code to
get loaded.</p> <p>However, if another process has the driver loaded,
calling <strong>reload_driver</strong> returns error code
<strong>pending_process</strong>. As stated earlier,
the recommended design is to not allow other
<a href="#users">users</a> than the "driver
reloader" to demand loading of the driver in question.</p> </dd></dl> </dd></dl></p><h1>Data Types</h1><span class="name">driver</span><span class="name">path</span><h1>Functions</h1><h2>demonitor/1</h2><p>Remove a monitor for a driver.</p><p>Removes a driver monitor in much the same way as

returns <strong>true</strong>, all other options return
<strong>linked_in_driver</strong> or <strong>permanent</strong>, respectively.</p><p>The function throws a <strong>badarg</strong> exception if the driver
is not present in the system or if the tag is not supported.</p><h2>load/2</h2><p>Load a driver.</p><p>Loads and links the dynamic driver <strong><span class="anno">Name</span></strong>.
<strong><span class="anno">Path</span></strong>
is a file path to the directory containing the driver.
<strong><span class="anno">Name</span></strong> must be a sharable object/dynamic library. Two
drivers with different <strong><span class="anno">Path</span></strong> parameters cannot be
loaded under the same name. <strong><span class="anno">Name</span></strong> is a string or
atom containing at least one character.</p><p>The <strong><span class="anno">Name</span></strong> specified is to correspond to the filename
of the dynamically loadable object file residing in
the directory specified as <strong><span class="anno">Path</span></strong>, but <em>without</em> the
extension (that is, <strong>.so</strong>). The driver name provided in
the driver initialization routine must correspond with the
filename, in much the same way as Erlang module names
correspond to the names of the <strong>.beam</strong> files.</p><p>If the driver was previously unloaded, but is still
present because of open ports to it, a call to
<strong>load/2</strong> stops the unloading and keeps the driver
(as long as <strong><span class="anno">Path</span></strong> is the same), and <strong>ok</strong> is
returned. If you really want the object code to be
reloaded, use <a href="#reload/2">reload/2</a>
or the low-level interface
<a href="#try_load/3">try_load/3</a> instead.
See also the description of
<a href="#scenarios">scenarios</a> for
loading/unloading in the introduction.</p><p>If more than one process tries to load an already loaded
driver with the same <strong><span class="anno">Path</span></strong>, or if the same process
tries to load it many times, the function returns
<strong>ok</strong>. The emulator keeps track of the
<strong>load/2</strong> calls, so that a corresponding number of
<strong>unload/2</strong> calls must be done from the same
process before the driver gets unloaded. It is
therefore safe for an application to load a driver that is
shared between processes or applications when needed. It can
safely be unloaded without causing trouble for other
parts of the system.</p><p>It is not allowed to load multiple drivers with
the same name but with different <strong>Path</strong> parameters.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p><strong><span class="anno">Path</span></strong> is interpreted
literally, so that all loaders of the same driver must
specify the same <em>literal</em> <strong><span class="anno">Path</span></strong> string,
although different paths can point out the same directory
in the file system (because of use of relative paths and
links).</p></div><p>On success, the function returns <strong>ok</strong>. On
failure, the return value is <strong>{error,<span class="anno">ErrorDesc</span>}</strong>,
where <strong><span class="anno">ErrorDesc</span></strong> is an opaque term to be
translated into human readable form by function
<a href="#format_error/1">format_error/1</a>.</p><p>For more control over the error handling, use the
<a href="#try_load/3">try_load/3</a>
interface instead.</p><p>The function throws a <strong>badarg</strong> exception if the
parameters are not specified as described here.</p><h2>load_driver/2</h2><p>Load a driver.</p><p>Works essentially as <strong>load/2</strong>, but loads the driver
with other options. All ports using the
driver are killed with reason <strong>driver_unloaded</strong>
when the driver is to be unloaded.</p><p>The number of loads and unloads by different
<a href="#users">users</a> influences the loading
and unloading of a driver file. The port killing
therefore only occurs when the <em>last</em>
<a href="#users">user</a> unloads the driver,
or when the last process having loaded the driver exits.</p><p>This interface (or at least the name of the functions) is
kept for backward compatibility.
Using <a href="#try_load/3">try_load/3</a> with
<strong>{driver_options,[kill_ports]}</strong> in the option list
gives the same effect regarding the port killing.</p><p>The function throws a <strong>badarg</strong> exception if the
parameters are not specified as described here.</p><h2>loaded_drivers/0</h2><p>List loaded drivers.</p><p>Returns a list of all the available drivers, both
(statically) linked-in and dynamically loaded ones.</p><p>The driver names are returned as a list of strings rather
than a list of atoms for historical reasons.</p><p>For more information about drivers, see
<a href="#info/0">info/0</a>.</p><h2>monitor/2</h2><p>Create a monitor for a driver.</p><p>Creates a driver monitor and works in many
ways as
<a href="../erts/erlang#monitor/2">erts/erlang#monitor/2</a>
in ERTS,
does for processes. When a driver changes state, the monitor
results in a monitor message that is sent to the calling
process. <strong><span class="anno">MonitorRef</span></strong> returned by this function is
included in the message sent.</p><p>As with process monitors, each driver monitor set only
generates <em>one single message</em>. The monitor is
"destroyed" after the message is sent, so it is then not
needed to call
<a href="#demonitor/1">demonitor/1</a>.</p><p><strong><span class="anno">MonitorRef</span></strong> can also be used in subsequent calls
to <a href="#demonitor/1">demonitor/1</a> to
remove a monitor.</p><p>The function accepts the following parameters:</p><dl><dt><strong><span class="anno">Tag</span></strong></dt><dd> <p>The monitor tag is always <strong>driver</strong>, as this function
can only be used to create driver monitors. In the future,
driver monitors will be integrated with process monitors,
why this parameter has to be specified for consistence.</p> </dd><dt><strong><span class="anno">Item</span></strong></dt><dd> <p>Parameter <strong><span class="anno">Item</span></strong> specifies
which driver to monitor (the driver name) and
which state change to monitor. The parameter
is a tuple of arity two whose first element is the
driver name and second element is one of the following:</p> <dl><dt><strong>loaded</strong></dt><dd> <p>Notifies when the driver is reloaded (or loaded if
loading is underway). It only makes sense to monitor
drivers that are in the process of being loaded or
reloaded. A future driver name for loading cannot be
monitored. That only results in a
<strong>DOWN</strong> message sent immediately.
Monitoring for loading is therefore most useful when
triggered by function
<a href="#try_load/3">try_load/3</a>,
where the monitor is created <em>because</em> the
driver is in such a pending state.</p> <p>Setting a driver monitor for <strong>loading</strong>
eventually leads to one of the following messages
being sent:</p> <dl><dt><strong>{'UP', reference(), driver, Name, loaded}</strong></dt><dd> <p>This message is sent either immediately if the
driver is already loaded and no reloading is
pending, or when reloading is executed if
reloading is pending. </p> <p>The <a href="#users">user</a> is
expected to know if reloading is demanded before
creating a monitor for loading.</p> </dd><dt><strong>{'UP', reference(), driver, Name, permanent}</strong></dt><dd> <p>This message is sent if reloading was
expected, but the (old) driver made itself
permanent before reloading. It is also
sent if the driver was permanent or statically
linked-in when trying to create the monitor.</p> </dd><dt><strong>{'DOWN', reference(), driver, Name, load_cancelled}</strong></dt><dd> <p>This message arrives if reloading was
underway, but the requesting
<a href="#users">user</a>
cancelled it by dying or calling
<a href="#try_unload/2">try_unload/2</a>
(or <strong>unload/1</strong>/<strong>unload_driver/1</strong>)
again before it was reloaded.</p> </dd><dt><strong>{'DOWN', reference(), driver, Name, {load_failure, Failure}}</strong></dt><dd> <p>This message arrives if reloading was
underway but the loading for some reason
failed. The <strong>Failure</strong> term is one of the
errors that can be returned from
<a href="#try_load/3">try_load/3</a>.
The error term can be passed to
<a href="#format_error/1">format_error/1</a>
for translation into human readable form. Notice
that the translation must be done in the same
running Erlang virtual machine as the error
was detected in.</p> </dd></dl> </dd><dt><strong>unloaded</strong></dt><dd> <p>Monitors when a driver gets unloaded. If one
monitors a driver that is not present in the system,
one immediately gets notified that the driver got
unloaded. There is no guarantee that the driver was
ever loaded.</p> <p>A driver monitor for unload eventually results
in one of the following messages being sent:</p> <dl><dt><strong>{'DOWN', reference(), driver, Name, unloaded}</strong></dt><dd> <p>The monitored driver instance is now
unloaded. As the unload can be a result of a
<strong>reload/2</strong> request, the driver can once
again have been loaded when this message
arrives.</p> </dd><dt><strong>{'UP', reference(), driver, Name, unload_cancelled}</strong></dt><dd> <p>This message is sent if unloading was
expected, but while the driver was waiting for
all ports to get closed, a new
<a href="#users">user</a> of the driver
appeared, and the unloading was cancelled.</p> <p>This message appears if <strong>{ok, pending_driver}</strong>
was returned from
<a href="#try_unload/2">try_unload/2</a>
for the last <a href="#users">user</a>
of the driver, and then <strong>{ok, already_loaded}</strong> is returned
from a call to
<a href="#try_load/3">try_load/3</a>.</p> <p>If one <em>really</em> wants to monitor when the
driver gets unloaded, this message distorts
the picture, because no unloading was done.
Option <strong>unloaded_only</strong> creates a monitor
similar to an <strong>unloaded</strong> monitor, but
never results in this message.</p> </dd><dt><strong>{'UP', reference(), driver, Name, permanent}</strong></dt><dd> <p>This message is sent if unloading was
expected, but the driver made itself
permanent before unloading. It is also
sent if trying to monitor a permanent or
statically linked-in driver.</p> </dd></dl> </dd><dt><strong>unloaded_only</strong></dt><dd> <p>A monitor created as <strong>unloaded_only</strong> behaves
exactly as one created as <strong>unloaded</strong>
except that the
<strong>{'UP', reference(), driver, Name, unload_cancelled}</strong>
message is never sent, but the monitor instead persists until
the driver <em>really</em> gets unloaded.</p> </dd></dl> </dd></dl><p>The function throws a <strong>badarg</strong> exception if the

(used in parameter <strong><span class="anno">Name</span></strong>) and the driver must
identify itself with the same name.
<strong><span class="anno">Path</span></strong> can be provided as an <em>iolist()</em>,
meaning it can be a list of other <strong>iolist()</strong>s, characters
(8-bit integers), or binaries, all to be flattened
into a sequence of characters.</p> <p>The (possibly flattened) <strong><span class="anno">Path</span></strong> parameter must be

The exception is when <em>reloading</em> is requested,

differently. Notice that all

driver later need to use the
<em>new</em> <strong><span class="anno">Path</span></strong> if <strong><span class="anno">Path</span></strong>

an <strong>atom()</strong>. The name specified when loading is used
to find the object file (with the help of <strong><span class="anno">Path</span></strong>
and the system-implied extension suffix, that is, <strong>.so</strong>).
The name by which the driver identifies itself must also be consistent
with this <strong><span class="anno">Name</span></strong> parameter, much as
the module name of a Beam file much corresponds to its filename.</p> </dd><dt><strong><span class="anno">OptionList</span></strong></dt><dd> <p>Some options can be specified to control the

always to be consistent, <em>even when the driver is reloaded</em>,
meaning that they are as much a part of the driver as the name.</p> <p>The only allowed driver option is
<strong>kill_ports</strong>, which means that all ports opened
to the driver are killed with exit reason
<strong>driver_unloaded</strong> when no process any longer
has the driver loaded. This situation arises either
when the last <a href="#users">user</a> calls
<a href="#try_unload/2">try_unload/2</a>, or
when the last process having loaded the driver exits.</p> </dd><dt><strong>{monitor, <span class="anno">MonitorOption</span>}</strong></dt><dd> <p>A <strong><span class="anno">MonitorOption</span></strong> tells <strong>try_load/3</strong> to
trigger a driver monitor under certain
conditions. When the monitor is triggered, the
function returns a three-tuple
<strong>{ok, <span class="anno">PendingStatus</span>, reference()}</strong>, where
<strong>reference()</strong> is the monitor reference for the driver monitor.</p> <p>Only one <strong><span class="anno">MonitorOption</span></strong> can be specified.
It is one of the following:</p> <ul><li> <p>The atom <strong>pending</strong>, which means
that a monitor is to be created whenever a load
operation is delayed,</p> </li><li> <p>The atom <strong>pending_driver</strong>, in which a monitor
is created whenever the operation is delayed because
of open ports to an otherwise unused driver.</p> </li></ul> <p>Option <strong>pending_driver</strong> is of little use, but
is present for completeness, as it is well defined which
reload options that can give rise to which delays.
However, it can be a good idea to use the same
<strong><span class="anno">MonitorOption</span></strong> as the
<strong><span class="anno">ReloadOption</span></strong>, if present.</p> <p>If reloading is not requested, it can still be
useful to specify option <strong>monitor</strong>, as
forced unloads (driver option <strong>kill_ports</strong> or
option <strong>kill_ports</strong> to
<a href="#try_unload/2">try_unload/2</a>)
trigger a transient state where driver loading
cannot be performed until all closing ports are
closed. Thus, as <strong>try_unload</strong> can, in
almost all situations, return <strong>{ok, pending_driver}</strong>,
always specify at least <strong>{monitor, pending_driver}</strong>
in production code (see the monitor discussion earlier).</p> </dd><dt><strong>{reload, <span class="anno">ReloadOption</span>}</strong></dt><dd> <p>This option is used to
<em>reload</em> a driver from disk, most often in a
code upgrade scenario. Having a <strong>reload</strong> option
also implies that parameter <strong><span class="anno">Path</span></strong> does
<em>not</em> need to be consistent with earlier loads of
the driver.</p> <p>To reload a driver, the process must have loaded the driver
before, that is, there must be an active
<a href="#users">user</a> of the driver
in the process.</p> <p>The <strong>reload</strong> option can be either of the following:</p> <dl><dt><strong>pending</strong></dt><dd> <p>With the atom <strong>pending</strong>, reloading is requested
for any driver and is effectuated when <em>all</em>
ports opened to the driver are closed. The driver
replacement in this case takes
place regardless if there are still
pending <a href="#users">users</a>
having the driver loaded.</p> <p>The option also triggers port-killing (if driver
option <strong>kill_ports</strong> is used) although
there are pending users, making it usable for forced
driver replacement, but laying much
responsibility on the driver
<a href="#users">users</a>.
The pending option is seldom used as one does not want other
<a href="#users">users</a> to have loaded
the driver when code change is underway.</p></dd><dt><strong>pending_driver</strong></dt><dd> <p>This option is more useful. Here, reloading is queued
if the driver is <em>not</em> loaded by any other
<a href="#users">users</a>, but the
driver has opened ports, in which case
<strong>{ok, pending_driver}</strong> is returned
(a <strong>monitor</strong> option is recommended).</p></dd></dl> <p>If the driver is unloaded (not present in the system),
error code <strong>not_loaded</strong> is returned. Option
<strong>reload</strong> is intended for when the user
has already loaded the driver in advance.</p> </dd></dl> </dd></dl><p>The function can return numerous errors, some
can only be returned given a certain combination of options.</p><p>Some errors are opaque and can only be interpreted by
passing them to function
<a href="#format_error/1">format_error/1</a>,
but some can be interpreted directly:</p><dl><dt><strong>{error,linked_in_driver}</strong></dt><dd> <p>The driver with the specified name is an Erlang
statically linked-in driver, which cannot be manipulated
with this API.</p> </dd><dt><strong>{error,inconsistent}</strong></dt><dd> <p>The driver is already loaded with other
<strong><span class="anno">DriverOptionList</span></strong> or a different
<em>literal</em> <strong>Path</strong> argument.</p> <p>This can occur even if a <strong>reload</strong> option is specified,
if <strong>DriverOptionList</strong> differs from the current.</p> </dd><dt><strong>{error, permanent}</strong></dt><dd> <p>The driver has requested itself to be permanent, making
it behave like an Erlang linked-in driver and can no
longer be manipulated with this API.</p> </dd><dt><strong>{error, pending_process}</strong></dt><dd> <p>The driver is loaded by other
<a href="#users">users</a> when
option <strong>{reload, pending_driver}</strong> was specified.</p> </dd><dt><strong>{error, pending_reload}</strong></dt><dd> <p>Driver reload is already requested by another
<a href="#users">user</a> when option
<strong>{reload, <span class="anno">ReloadOption</span>}</strong> was specified.</p> </dd><dt><strong>{error, not_loaded_by_this_process}</strong></dt><dd> <p>Appears when option <strong>reload</strong> is specified. The
driver <strong><span class="anno">Name</span></strong> is present in the system, but there
is no <a href="#users">user</a> of it in this
process.</p> </dd><dt><strong>{error, not_loaded}</strong></dt><dd> <p>Appears when option <strong>reload</strong> is specified. The
driver <strong><span class="anno">Name</span></strong> is not in the system. Only drivers
loaded by this process can be reloaded.</p> </dd></dl><p>All other error codes are to be translated by function
<a href="#format_error/1">format_error/1</a>.
Notice that calls to <strong>format_error</strong> are to be
performed from the same running instance of the Erlang
virtual machine as the error is detected in, because of
system-dependent behavior concerning error values.</p><p>If the arguments or options are malformed, the function
throws a <strong>badarg</strong> exception.</p><h2>try_unload/2</h2><p>Unload a driver.</p><p>This is the low-level function to unload (or decrement
reference counts of) a driver. It can be used to force port
killing, in much the same way as the driver option
<strong>kill_ports</strong> implicitly does. Also, it can trigger a
monitor either because other
<a href="#users">users</a> still have the driver
loaded or because open ports use the driver.</p><p>Unloading can be described as the process of telling the
emulator that this particular part of the code in this
particular process (that is, this
<a href="#users">user</a>) no longer needs
the driver. That can, if there are no other users, trigger
unloading of the driver, in which case the driver name
disappears from the system and (if possible) the memory
occupied by the driver executable code is reclaimed.</p><p>If the driver has option <strong>kill_ports</strong> set, or if
<strong>kill_ports</strong> is specified as an option to this
function, all pending ports using this driver are
killed when unloading is done by the last
<a href="#users">user</a>. If no port-killing
is involved and there are open ports, the unloading
is delayed until no more open ports use the
driver. If, in this case, another
<a href="#users">user</a> (or even this user)
loads the driver again before the driver is unloaded, the
unloading never takes place.</p><p>To allow the <a href="#users">user</a> to
<em>request unloading</em> to wait for <em>actual unloading</em>,
<strong>monitor</strong> triggers can be specified in much the same way as
when loading. However, as <a href="#users">users</a>
of this function seldom are interested in more than decrementing the
reference counts, monitoring is seldom needed.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p> If option <strong>kill_ports</strong> is used, monitor trigging is crucial,
as the ports are not guaranteed to be killed until the driver is unloaded.
Thus, a monitor must be triggered for at least the <strong>pending_driver</strong>
case.</p></div><p>The possible monitor messages to expect are the
same as when using option <strong>unloaded</strong> to function
<a href="#monitor/2">monitor/2</a>.</p><p>The function returns one of the following statuses upon
success:</p><dl><dt><strong>{ok, unloaded}</strong></dt><dd> <p>The driver was immediately unloaded, meaning that the
driver name is now free to use by other drivers and, if
the underlying OS permits it, the memory occupied by the
driver object code is now reclaimed.</p> <p>The driver can only be unloaded when there are no open
ports using it and no more
<a href="#users">users</a> require it to be
loaded.</p> </dd><dt><strong>{ok, pending_driver}</strong>or <strong>{ok, pending_driver, reference()}</strong></dt><dd> <p>Indicates that this call removed the last
<a href="#users">user</a> from the
driver, but there are still open ports using it.
When all ports are closed and no new
<a href="#users">users</a> have arrived,
the driver is reloaded and the name and memory
reclaimed.</p> <p>This return value is valid even if option <strong>kill_ports</strong>
was used, as killing ports can be a process that does not
complete immediately. However, the condition is in that case
transient. Monitors are always useful to detect when the driver
is really unloaded.</p> </dd><dt><strong>{ok, pending_process}</strong>or <strong>{ok, pending_process, reference()}</strong></dt><dd> <p>The unload request is registered, but
other <a href="#users">users</a> still hold
the driver. Notice that the term <strong>pending_process</strong>
can refer to the running process; there can be more
than one <a href="#users">user</a> in the
same process.</p> <p>This is a normal, healthy, return value if the call was
just placed to inform the emulator that you have no
further use of the driver. It is the most
common return value in the most common
<a href="#scenarios">scenarios</a>
described in the introduction.</p> </dd></dl><p>The function accepts the following parameters:</p><dl><dt><strong><span class="anno">Name</span></strong></dt><dd> <p><strong><span class="anno">Name</span></strong> is the name of the
driver to be unloaded. The name can be specified as an
<strong>iolist()</strong> or as an <strong>atom()</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong><span class="anno">OptionList</span></strong></dt><dd> <p>Argument <strong><span class="anno">OptionList</span></strong> can be used to specify
certain behavior regarding ports and triggering
monitors under certain conditions:</p> <dl><dt><strong>kill_ports</strong></dt><dd> <p>Forces killing of all ports opened using this driver,
with exit reason <strong>driver_unloaded</strong>, if you are
the <em>last</em> <a href="#users">user</a>
of the driver.</p> <p>If other <a href="#users">users</a>
have the driver loaded, this option has no effect.</p> <p>To get the consistent behavior of killing ports
when the last <a href="#users">user</a>
unloads, use driver option
<strong>kill_ports</strong> when loading the driver instead.</p> </dd><dt><strong>{monitor, <span class="anno">MonitorOption</span>}</strong></dt><dd> <p>Creates a driver monitor if the condition
specified in <strong><span class="anno">MonitorOption</span></strong> is true. The valid
options are:</p> <dl><dt><strong>pending_driver</strong></dt><dd> <p>Creates a driver monitor if the return value is to
be <strong>{ok, pending_driver}</strong>.</p> </dd><dt><strong>pending</strong></dt><dd> <p>Creates a monitor if the return value is
<strong>{ok, pending_driver}</strong> or <strong>{ok, pending_process}</strong>.</p> </dd></dl> <p>The <strong>pending_driver</strong> <strong><span class="anno">MonitorOption</span></strong> is
by far the most useful. It must be used to ensure that the
driver really is unloaded and the ports closed
whenever option <strong>kill_ports</strong> is used, or the
driver can have been loaded with driver option
<strong>kill_ports</strong>.</p> <p>Using the monitor triggers in the call to
<strong>try_unload</strong> ensures that the monitor is
added before the unloading is executed, meaning
that the monitor is always properly triggered,

separately.</p> </dd></dl> </dd></dl><p>The function can return the following error conditions,
