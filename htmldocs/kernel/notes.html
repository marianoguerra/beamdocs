opened with the <strong>compressed</strong> flag.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15706 Aux Id: ERIERL-336 </p> </li></ul><h2>Kernel 6.3</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
If for example the <strong>/etc/hosts</strong> did not come into
existence until after the kernel application had started,
its content was never read. This bug has now been
corrected.</p> <p>

<strong>atom()</strong> and <strong>string()</strong>.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15557 Aux Id: PR-2117 </p> </li><li> <p>
The Logger handler logger_std_h now keeps track of the
inode of its log file in order to re-open the file if the
inode changes. This may happen, for instance, if the log
file is opened and saved by an editor.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15578 Aux Id: ERL-850 </p> </li><li> <p>
When user specific file modes are given to the logger
handler <strong>logger_std_h</strong>, they were earlier accepted
without any control. This is now changes, so Logger will
adjust the file modes as follows:</p> <p>
- If <strong>raw</strong> is not found in the list, it is
added.<br/> - If none of <strong>write</strong>, <strong>append</strong> or
<strong>exclusive</strong> are found in the list, <strong>append</strong> is
added.<br/> - If none of <strong>delayed_write</strong> or
<strong>{delayed_write,Size,Delay}</strong> are found in the list,
<strong>delayed_write</strong> is added.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15602</p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>
The standard logger handler, <strong>logger_std_h</strong>, now has
a new internal feature for log rotation. The rotation
scheme is as follows:</p> <p>
The log file to which the handler currently writes always
has the same name, i.e. the name which is configured for
the handler. The archived files have the same name, but
with extension ".N", where N is an integer. The newest
archive has extension ".0", and the oldest archive has
the highest number. </p> <p>
The size at which the log file is rotated, and the number
of archive files that are kept, is specified with the
handler specific configuration parameters
<strong>max_no_bytes</strong> and <strong>max_no_files</strong> respectively. </p> <p>
Archives can be compressed, in which case they get a
".gz" file extension after the integer. Compression is
specified with the handler specific configuration
parameter <strong>compress_on_rotate</strong>.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15479</p> </li><li> <p>
The new functions <strong>logger:i/0</strong> and <strong>logger:i/1</strong>
are added. These provide the same information as
<strong>logger:get_config/0</strong> and other
<strong>logger:get_*_config</strong> functions, but the information
is more logically sorted and more readable.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15600</p> </li><li> <p>
Logger is now protected against overload due to massive
amounts of log events from the emulator or from remote
nodes.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15601</p> </li><li> <p>
Logger now uses os:system_time/1 instead of
erlang:system_time/1 to generate log event timestamps.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15625</p> </li><li> <p>
Add functions <strong>application:set_env/1,2</strong> and
<strong>application:set_env/2</strong>. These take a list of
application configuration parameters, and the behaviour
is equivalent to calling <strong>application:set_env/4</strong>
individually for each application/key combination, except
it is more efficient.</p> <p>
<strong>set_env/1,2</strong> warns about duplicated applications or
keys. The warning is also emitted during boot, if
applications or keys are duplicated within one
configuration file, e.g. sys.config.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15642 Aux Id: PR-2164 </p> </li><li> <p>
Handler specific configuration parameters for the
standard handler <strong>logger_std_h</strong> are changed to be
more intuitive and more similar to the disk_log handler.</p> <p>
Earlier there was only one parameter, <strong>type</strong>, which
could have the values <strong>standard_io</strong>,
<strong>standard_error</strong>, <strong>{file,FileName}</strong> or
<strong>{file,FileName,Modes}</strong>.</p> <p>
This is now changed, so the following parameters are
allowed:</p> <p>
<strong>type = standard_io | standard_error | file</strong><br/>
<strong>file = file:filename()</strong><br/> <strong>modes = [file:mode()]</strong></p> <p>
All parameters are optional. <strong>type</strong> defaults to
<strong>standard_io</strong>, unless a file name is given, in which
case it defaults to <strong>file</strong>. If <strong>type</strong> is set to
<strong>file</strong>, the file name defaults to the same as the
handler id.</p> <p>
The potential incompatibility is that
<strong>logger:get_config/0</strong> and
<strong>logger:get_handler_config/1</strong> now returns the new
parameters, even if the configuration was set with the
old variant, e.g. <strong>#{type=&gt;{file,FileName}}</strong>.</p> <p>
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15662</p> </li><li> <p>
The new configuration parameter <strong>file_check</strong> is
added to the Logger handler <strong>logger_std_h</strong>. This
parameter specifies how long (in milliseconds) the
handler may wait before checking if the log file still
exists and the inode is the same as when it was opened.</p> <p>
The default value is 0, which means that this check is
done prior to each write operation. Setting a higher
number may improve performance, but adds the risk of
loosing log events.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15663</p> </li></ul><h2>Kernel 6.2.1</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
Setting the <strong>recbuf</strong> size of an inet socket the
<strong>buffer</strong> is also automatically increased. Fix a bug
where the auto adjustment of inet buffer size would be
triggered even if an explicit inet buffer size had
already been set.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15651 Aux Id: ERIERL-304 </p> </li></ul><h2>Kernel 6.2</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
A new function, <strong>logger:update_handler_config/3</strong> is
added, and the handler callback <strong>changing_config</strong>
now has a new argument, <strong>SetOrUpdate</strong>, which
indicates if the configuration change comes from
<strong>set_handler_config/2,3</strong> or
<strong>update_handler_config/2,3</strong>.</p> <p>
This allows the handler to consistently merge the new
configuration with the old (if the change comes from
<strong>update_handler_config/2,3</strong>) or with the default (if
the change comes from <strong>set_handler_config/2,3</strong>).</p> <p>
The built-in handlers <strong>logger_std_h</strong> and
<strong>logger_disk_log_h</strong> are updated accordingly. A bug
which could cause inconsistency between the handlers'
internal state and the stored configuration is also
corrected.</p> <p>
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15364</p> </li><li> <p>
Fix fallback when custom erl_epmd client does not
implement address_please.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15388 Aux Id: PR-1983 </p> </li><li> <p>
The logger ets table did not have the
<strong>read_concurrency</strong> option. This is now added.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15453 Aux Id: ERL-782 </p> </li><li> <p>
During system start, logger has a simple handler which
prints to stdout. After the kernel supervision is
started, this handler is removed and replaced by the
default handler. Due to a bug, logger earlier issued a
debug printout saying it received an unexpected message,
which was the EXIT message from the simple handler's
process. This is now corrected. The simple handler's
process now unlinks from the logger process before
terminating.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15466 Aux Id: ERL-788 </p> </li><li> <p>
The logger handler <strong>logger_std_h</strong> would not
re-create it's log file if it was removed. Due to this it
could not be used with tools like 'logrotate'. This is
now corrected.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15469</p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>
A function <strong>inet:getifaddrs/1</strong> that takes a list
with a namespace option has been added, for platforms
that support that feature, for example Linux (only?).</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15121 Aux Id: ERIERL-189, PR-1974 </p> </li><li> <p>Added the <strong>nopush</strong> option for TCP sockets, which
corresponds to <strong>TCP_NOPUSH</strong> on *BSD and
<strong>TCP_CORK</strong> on Linux.</p> <p>This is also used internally in <strong>file:sendfile</strong>
to reduce latency on subsequent send operations.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15357 Aux Id: ERL-698 </p> </li><li> <p>
Optimize handling of send_delay for tcp sockes to better
work with the new pollthread implementation introduced in
OTP-21.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15471 Aux Id: ERIERL-229 </p> </li></ul><h2>Kernel 6.1.1</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
Fix bug causing net_kernel process crash on connection
attempt from node with name identical to local node.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15438 Aux Id: ERL-781 </p> </li></ul><h2>Kernel 6.1</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
The values <strong>all</strong> and <strong>none</strong> are documented as
valid value for the Kernel configuration parameter
<strong>logger_level</strong>, but would cause a crash during node
start. This is now corrected.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15143</p> </li><li> <p>
Fix some potential buggy behavior in how ticks are sent
on inter node distribution connections. Tick is now sent
to c-node even if there are unsent buffered data, as
c-nodes need ticks in order to send reply ticks. The
amount of sent data was also calculated wrongly when
ticks were suppressed due to unsent buffered data.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15162 Aux Id: ERIERL-191 </p> </li><li> <p>
Non semantic change in dist_util.erl to silence dialyzer
warning.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15170</p> </li><li> <p>
Fixed <strong>net_kernel:connect_node(node())</strong> to return
<strong>true</strong> (and do nothing) as it always has before
OTP-21.0. Also documented this successful "self connect"
as the expected behavior.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15182 Aux Id: ERL-643 </p> </li><li> <p>
The single_line option on logger_formatter would in some
cases add an unwanted comma after the association arrows
in a map. This is now corrected.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15228</p> </li><li> <p>
Improved robustness of distribution connection setup. In
OTP-21.0 a truly asynchronous connection setup was
introduced. This is further improvement on that work to
make the emulator more robust and also be able to recover
in cases when involved Erlang processes misbehave.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15297 Aux Id: OTP-15279, OTP-15280 </p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>
A new macro, <strong>?LOG(Level,...)</strong>, is added. This is
equivalent to the existing <strong>?LOG_&lt;LEVEL&gt;(...)</strong>
macros.</p> <p>
A new variant of Logger report callback is added, which
takes an extra argument containing options for size
limiting and line breaks. Module <strong>proc_lib</strong> in
<strong>STDLIB</strong> uses this for crash reports.</p> <p>
Logger configuration is now checked a bit more for
errors.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15132</p> </li><li> <p>
The socket options <strong>recvtos</strong>, <strong>recvttl</strong>,
<strong>recvtclass</strong> and <strong>pktoptions</strong> have been
implemented in the socket modules. See the documentation
for the <strong>gen_tcp</strong>, <strong>gen_udp</strong> and <strong>inet</strong>
modules. Note that support for these in the runtime
system is platform dependent. Especially for
<strong>pktoptions</strong> which is very Linux specific and
obsoleted by the RFCs that defined it.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15145 Aux Id: ERIERL-187 </p> </li><li> <p>
Add <strong>logger:set_application_level/2</strong> for setting the
logger level of all modules in one application.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15146</p> </li></ul><h2>Kernel 6.0.1</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>
Fixed bug in <strong>net_kernel</strong> that could cause an
emulator crash if certain connection attempts failed. Bug
exists since kernel-6.0 (OTP-21.0).</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15280 Aux Id: ERIERL-226, OTP-15279 </p> </li></ul><h2>Kernel 6.0</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p> Clarify the documentation of <strong>rpc:multicall/5</strong>.
</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-10551</p> </li><li> <p>
The DNS resolver when getting econnrefused from a server
retained an invalid socket so look up towards the next
server(s) also failed.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-13133 Aux Id: PR-1557 </p> </li><li> <p>
No resolver backend returns V4Mapped IPv6 addresses any
more. This was inconsistent before, some did, some did
not. To facilitate working with such addresses a new
function <strong>inet:ipv4_mapped_ipv6_address/1</strong> has been
added.</p> <p>
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-13761 Aux Id: ERL-503 </p> </li><li> <p>
The type specifications for <strong>file:posix/0</strong> and
<strong>inet:posix/0</strong> have been updated according to which
errors file and socket operations should be able to
return.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14019 Aux Id: ERL-550 </p> </li><li> <p>
Fix name resolving in IPv6 only environments when doing
the initial distributed connection.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14501</p> </li><li> <p> File operations used to accept <a href="../kernel/file#type-name_all">filenames</a>
containing null characters (integer value zero). This
caused the name to be truncated and in some cases
arguments to primitive operations to be mixed up.
Filenames containing null characters inside the filename
are now <em>rejected</em> and will cause primitive file
operations to fail. </p> <p> Also environment variable
operations used to accept <a href="../kernel/os#type-env_var_name">names</a> and
<a href="../kernel/os#type-env_var_value">values</a> of
environment variables containing null characters (integer
value zero). This caused operations to silently produce
erroneous results. Environment variable names and values
containing null characters inside the name or value are
now <em>rejected</em> and will cause environment variable
operations to fail. </p> <p>Primitive environment
variable operations also used to accept the <strong>$=</strong>
character in environment variable names causing various
problems. <strong>$=</strong> characters in environment variable
names are now also <em>rejected</em>. </p> <p>Also
<a href="../kernel/os#cmd/1">kernel/os#cmd/1</a> now
reject null characters inside its <a href="../kernel/os#type-os_command">command</a>.
</p> <p><a href="../erts/erlang#open_port/2">erts/erlang#open_port/2</a>
will also reject null characters inside the port name
from now on.</p> <p>
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14543 Aux Id: ERL-370 </p> </li><li> <p><strong>os:putenv</strong> and <strong>os:getenv</strong> no longer access
the process environment directly and instead work on a
thread-safe emulation. The only observable difference is
that it's <em>not</em> kept in sync with libc
<strong>getenv(3)</strong> / <strong>putenv(3)</strong>, so those who relied
on that behavior in drivers or NIFs will need to add
manual synchronization.</p> <p>On Windows this means that
you can no longer resolve DLL dependencies by modifying
the <strong>PATH</strong> just before loading the driver/NIF. To
make this less of a problem, the emulator now adds the
target DLL's folder to the DLL search path.</p> <p>
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14666</p> </li><li> <p>
Fixed connection tick toward primitive hidden nodes
(erl_interface) that could cause faulty tick timeout in
rare cases when payload data is sent to hidden node but
not received.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14681</p> </li><li> <p>
Make group react immediately on an EXIT-signal from shell
in e.g ssh.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-14991 Aux Id: PR1705 </p> </li><li> <p>
Calls to <strong>gen_tcp:send/2</strong> on closed sockets now
returns <strong>{error, closed}</strong> instead of
<strong>{error,enotconn}</strong>.</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15001</p> </li><li> <p>
The <strong>included_applications</strong> key are no longer
duplicated as application environment variable. Earlier,
the included applications could be read both with
<strong>application:get[_all]_env(...)</strong> and
<strong>application:get[_all]_key(...)</strong> functions. Now, it
can only be read with
<strong>application:get[_all]_key(...)</strong>.</p> <p>
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15071</p> </li><li> <p>Owner and group changes through
<strong>file:write_file_info</strong>, <strong>file:change_owner</strong>,
and <strong>file:change_group</strong> will no longer report
success on permission errors.</p> <p>
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p>
Own Id: OTP-15118</p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>A new logging API is added to Erlang/OTP, see the
<a href="./logger">kernel/logger</a> manual
page, and section <a href="./logger_chapter">Logging</a> in the
Kernel User's Guide.</p> <p>Calls to <strong>error_logger</strong> are automatically
redirected to the new API, and legacy error logger event
handlers can still be used. It is, however, recommended
to use the Logger API directly when writing new code.</p> <p>Notice the following potential incompatibilities:</p> <ul><li><p>Kernel configuration parameters
<strong>error_logger</strong> still works, but is overruled if the
default handler's output destination is configured with
Kernel configuration parameter <strong>logger</strong>.</p> <p>In
general, parameters for configuring error logger are
overwritten by new parameters for configuring
Logger.</p></li><li><p>The concept of SASL error
logging is deprecated, meaning that by default the SASL
application does not affect which log events are
logged.</p> <p>By default, supervisor reports and crash
reports are logged by the default Logger handler started
by Kernel, and end up at the same destination (terminal
or file) as other standard log event from Erlang/OTP.</p> <p>Progress reports are not logged by default, but can be
enabled by setting the primary log level to info, for
example with the Kernel configuration parameter
<strong>logger_level</strong>.</p> <p>To obtain backwards
compatibility with the SASL error logging functionality
from earlier releases, set Kernel configuration parameter
<strong>logger_sasl_compatible</strong> to <strong>true</strong>. This
prevents the default Logger handler from logging any
supervisor-, crash-, or progress reports. Instead, SASL
adds a separate Logger handler during application start,
which takes care of these log events. The SASL
configuration parameters <strong>sasl_error_logger</strong> and
<strong>sasl_errlog_type</strong> specify the destination (terminal
or file) and severity level to log for these
events.</p></li></ul> <p>
Since Logger is new in Erlang/OTP 21.0, we do reserve the
right to introduce changes to the Logger API and
functionality in patches following this release. These
changes might or might not be backwards compatible with
the initial version.</p> <p>

gen_tcp:shutdown/2 is now asynchronous</p> <p>

It doesn't truncate the output. The current version of
gen_tcp:shutdown/2 will truncate any outbound data in the
driver queue after about 10 seconds if the TCP peer is
idle of slow. Worse yet, it doesn't even inform anyone

The spec for file:set_cwd/1 is modified to also accept

Erlang/OTP has been ported to the realtime operating
system OSE. The port supports both smp and non-smp
emulator. For details around the port and how to started
see the User's Guide in the ose application. </p> <p>
Note that not all parts of Erlang/OTP has been ported. </p> <p>
Notable things that work are: non-smp and smp emulators,
OSE signal interaction, crypto, asn1, run_erl/to_erl,
tcp, epmd, distribution and most if not all non-os
specific functionality of Erlang.</p> <p>

Add the {active,N} socket option for TCP, UDP, and SCTP,
where N is an integer in the range -32768..32767, to
allow a caller to specify the number of data messages to
be delivered to the controlling process. Once the
socket's delivered message count either reaches 0 or is
explicitly set to 0 with inet:setopts/2 or by including
{active,0} as an option when the socket is created, the
socket transitions to passive ({active, false}) mode and
the socket's controlling process receives a message to
inform it of the transition. TCP sockets receive
{tcp_passive,Socket}, UDP sockets receive
{udp_passive,Socket} and SCTP sockets receive
{sctp_passive,Socket}. </p> <p>
The socket's delivered message counter defaults to 0, but
it can be set using {active,N} via any gen_tcp, gen_udp,
or gen_sctp function that takes socket options as
arguments, or via inet:setopts/2. New N values are added
to the socket's current counter value, and negative
numbers can be used to reduce the counter value.
Specifying a number that would cause the socket's counter
value to go above 32767 causes an einval error. If a
negative number is specified such that the counter value
would become negative, the socket's counter value is set
to 0 and the socket transitions to passive mode. If the
counter value is already 0 and inet:setopts(Socket,
[{active,0}]) is specified, the counter value remains at
0 but the appropriate passive mode transition message is
generated for the socket.</p> <p>

A call to either the <strong>garbage_collect/1</strong> BIF or the
<strong>check_process_code/2</strong> BIF may trigger garbage
collection of another processes than the process calling
the BIF. The previous implementations performed these
kinds of garbage collections without considering the
internal state of the process being garbage collected. In
order to be able to more easily and more efficiently
implement yielding native code, these types of garbage
collections have been rewritten. A garbage collection
like this is now triggered by an asynchronous request
signal, the actual garbage collection is performed by the
process being garbage collected itself, and finalized by
a reply signal to the process issuing the request. Using
this approach processes can disable garbage collection
and yield without having to set up the heap in a state
that can be garbage collected.</p> <p>
The <a href="../erts/erlang#garbage_collect/2">erts/erlang#garbage_collect/2</a>,
and <a href="../erts/erlang#check_process_code/3">erts/erlang#check_process_code/3</a>
BIFs have been introduced. Both taking an option list as
last argument. Using these, one can issue asynchronous
requests.</p> <p>
<strong>code:purge/1</strong> and <strong>code:soft_purge/1</strong> have
been rewritten to utilize asynchronous
<strong>check_process_code</strong> requests in order to
parallelize work.</p> <p>
Characteristics impact: A call to the
<strong>garbage_collect/1</strong> BIF or the
<strong>check_process_code/2</strong> BIF will normally take longer
time to complete while the system as a whole wont be as
much negatively effected by the operation as before. A
call to <strong>code:purge/1</strong> and <strong>code:soft_purge/1</strong>
may complete faster or slower depending on the state of
the system while the system as a whole wont be as much
negatively effected by the operation as before.</p> <p>

Guide: Inet configuration. </p><p> It can formally not be
incompatible with respect to earlier versions since there
was no earlier official version. However it was used
before and some details have changed. </p><p>
Configuration now initializes from /etc/resolv.conf and
/etc/hosts on all unix platforms regardless of which
distribution mode the node is started in. The directory
(/etc) these files are supposed to reside in can be
changed via an environment variable. These configuration
file locations can also be changed in the inet
configuration. The files are monitored for change and
re-read, which makes a few resolver configuration
variables out of application control. The /etc/hosts
entries have now their own cache table that is shadowed
(with lookup method 'file' is used) by the application
configured host entries. This problem (that inet_res
configuration only worked for distribution mode long
names) was among other reported by Matthew O'Gorman many
moons ago. </p><p> The lookup methods are still 'native'
only per default. Resolver configuration is done on all
Unix platforms just to get a usable configuration for
direct calls to inet_res. </p><p> The functions
<strong>inet_res:nslookup/3..5</strong> and
<strong>inet_res:nnslookup/4..4</strong> are no longer recommended
to use, instead use <strong>inet_res:lookup/3..5</strong> and
<strong>inet_res:resolve/3..5</strong> which provide clearer
argument types and the possibility to override options in
the call. </p><p> Users of previous unsupported versions
of inet_res have included internal header files to get to
the internal record definitions in order to examine DNS
replies. This is still unsupported and there are access
functions in inet_dns to use instead. These are
documented in inet_res(3). </p><p> Bug fix: a compression
reference loop would make DNS message decoding loop
forever. Problem reported by Florian Weimer. </p><p> Bug
fix and patch suggestion by Sergei Golovan: configuring
IPv6 nameservers did not work. His patch (as he warned)
created many UDP sockets; one per nameserver. This has
been fixed in the released version. </p><p> Improvement:
<strong>inet_res</strong> is now EDNS0 capable. The current
implementation is simple and does not probe and cache
EDNS info for nameservers, which a fully capable
implementation probably should do. EDNS has to be enabled
via resolver configuration, and if a nameserver replies
that it does not support EDNS, <strong>inet_res</strong> falls back
to a regular DNS query. </p><p> Improvement: now
<strong>inet_res</strong> automatically falls back to TCP if it
gets a truncated answer from a nameserver. </p><p>
Warning: some of the ancient and exotic record types
handled by <strong>inet_res</strong> and <strong>inet_dns</strong> are not
supported by current versions of BIND, so they could not
be tested after the rewrite, with reasonable effort, e.g
MD, MF, NULL, and SPF. The risk for bugs in these
particular records is still low since their code is
mostly shared with other tested record types. </p> <p>

and was claimed to work fine, tested on Linux Fedora Core
5.0 (kernel 2.6.15-2054 or later) and on Solaris 10 and
11. The OTP team rewrites used the same standard document
but might have accidentally broken some functionality. If
so, it will soon be patched to working state. The tricky
parts in C and the general design has essentially not
changed. During the rewrites the code was hand tested on
SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 10, and briefly on Solaris
10. Feedbach on code and docs is very much
appreciated.</p> <p>The SCTP interface is in beta state. It has only been
hand tested and has no automatic test suites in OTP
meaning everything is most certainly not tested. Socket
active mode is broken. IPv6 is not tested. The documentation
has been reworked due to the API changes,
but has not been proofread after this.</p> <p>Thank you from the OTP team to Serge Aleynikov and
Leonid Timochouk for a valuable contribution. We hope we
have not messed it up too much.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-6336</p> </li><li> <p>A <strong>{minor_version,Version}</strong> option is now recognized
by <strong>term_to_binary/2</strong>. {minor_version,1} will cause
floats to be encoded in an exact and more space-efficient
way compared to the previous encoding.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-6434</p> </li><li> <p>Monitoring of nodes has been improved. Now the following
properties apply to
<strong>net_kernel:monitor_nodes/[1,2]</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>nodeup</strong> messages will be delivered before delivery of any message from the remote node passed through the newly established connection. </li><li><strong>nodedown</strong> messages will not be delivered until all messages from the remote node that have been passed through the connection have been delivered. </li><li>Subscriptions can also be made before the <strong>net_kernel</strong> server has been started. </li></ul> <p>Own Id: OTP-6481</p> </li><li> <p>Setting and getting socket options in a "raw" fashion is
now allowed. Using this feature will inevitably produce
non portable code, but will allow setting ang getting
arbitrary uncommon options on TCP stacks that do have
them.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-6519</p> </li><li> <p>Dialyzer warnings have been eliminated.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-6523</p> </li><li> <p>The documentation for <strong>file:delete/1</strong> and
<strong>file:set_cwd/1</strong> has been updated to clarify what
happens if the input arguments are of an incorrect type.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-6535</p> </li></ul><h2>Kernel 2.11.3.1</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>An erroneous packet size could be used for the first
messages passed through a newly established connection
between two Erlang nodes. This could cause messages to be
discarded, or termination of the connection.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-6473</p> </li></ul><h2>Kernel 2.11.3</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>On Unix, the <strong>unix:cmd/1</strong> function could leave an
'EXIT' message in the message queue for the calling
process That problem was more likely to happen in an SMP
emulator.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-6368</p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>More interfaces are added in erl_ddll, to support
different usage scenarios.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-6307 Aux Id: OTP-6234 </p> </li><li> <p>Locks set by calling <strong>global:set_lock()</strong> were not
always deleted when the locking process died. This bug
has been fixed.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-6341 Aux Id: seq10445 </p> </li></ul><h2>Kernel 2.11.2</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>Behavior in case of disappeared nodes when using he
dist_auto_connect once got changed in R11B-1. The
timeouts regarding normal distributed operations is now
reverted to the old (pre R11B-1).</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-6258 Aux Id: OTP-6200, seq10449 </p> </li><li> <p>Start-up problems for the internal process used by the
<strong>inet:gethostbyname()</strong> functions were eliminated. If
the internal process (<strong>inet_gethost_native</strong>) had not
previously been started, and if several processes at the
same time called one of the <strong>inet:gethostbyname()</strong>
functions, the calls could fail.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-6286</p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>Code cleanup: the old internal obsolete file_server has
been removed. It was only used when communicating with R7
and older nodes.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-6245</p> </li><li> <p>Trying to open a non-existent or badly formed disk log
no longer results in a crash report. In particular,
<strong>ets:file2tab/1</strong> reports no error when the argument
is not a well-formed disk log file. (The return value has
not been changed, it is still an error tuple.)</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-6278 Aux Id: seq10421 </p> </li><li> <p>There are new BIFs <strong>erlang:spawn_monitor/1,3</strong>,
and the new option <strong>monitor</strong> for
<strong>spawn_opt/2,3,4,5</strong>.</p> <p>The <strong>observer_backend</strong> module has been updated to
handle the new BIFs.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-6281</p> </li><li> <p>To help Dialyzer find more bugs, many functions in the
Kernel and STDLIB applications now only accept arguments
of the type that is documented.</p> <p>For instance, the functions <strong>lists:prefix/2</strong> and
<strong>lists:suffix/2</strong> are documented to only accept lists
as their arguments, but they actually accepted anything
and returned <strong>false</strong>. That has been changed so that
the functions cause an exception if one or both arguments
are not lists.</p> <p>Also, the <strong>string:strip/3</strong> function is documented
to take a character argument that is a character to strip
from one or both ends of the string. Given a list instead
of a character, it used to do nothing, but will now cause
an exception.</p> <p>Dialyzer will find most cases where those functions
are passed arguments of the wrong type.</p> <p>*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-6295</p> </li></ul><h2>Kernel 2.11.1.1</h2><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>There is now an option read_packets for UDP sockets that
sets the maximum number of UDP packets that will be read
for each invocation of the socket driver.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-6249 Aux Id: seq10452 </p> </li></ul><h2>Kernel 2.11.1</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>In R11B-0, the erl_ddll server process is always started.
Despite that, the configuration parameter
<strong>start_ddll</strong> for the Kernel application was still
obeyed, which would cause the erl_ddll server to be
started TWICE (and the system shutting down as a result).
In this release, <strong>start_ddll</strong> is no longer used and
its documentation has been removed.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-6163</p> </li><li> <p>The kernel option {dist_auto_connect,once} could block
out nodes that had never been connected, causing
persistent partitioning of networks. Furthermore, partial
restarts of networks could cause inconsistent global name
databases. Both problems are now solved.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-6200 Aux Id: seq10377 </p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>Late arriving tcp_closed and udp_closed messages are now
removed from the message queue of a process calling
gen_tcp:close/1, gen_udp:close/1, and inet:close/1.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-6197</p> </li></ul><h2>Kernel 2.11</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>When repairing a disk log with a corrupt index file
(caused by for instance a hard disk failure) the old
contents of the index file is kept unmodified. This will
make repeated attempts to open the disk log fail every
time.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5558 Aux Id: seq9823 </p> </li><li> <p>Previously <strong>unlink/1</strong> and <strong>erlang:demonitor/2</strong>
behaved completely asynchronous. This had one undesirable
effect, though. You could never know when you were
guaranteed <em>not</em> to be affected by a link that you
had unlinked or a monitor that you had demonitored.</p> <p>The new behavior of <strong>unlink/1</strong> and
<strong>erlang:demonitor/2</strong> can be viewed as two operations
performed atomically. Asynchronously send an unlink
signal or a demonitor signal, and ignore any future
results of the link or monitor.</p> <p><em>NOTE</em>: This change can cause some obscure code
to fail which previously did not. For example, the
following code might hang:</p> <pre><code class="">
            Mon = erlang:monitor(process, Pid),
            %% ...
            exit(Pid, bang),
            erlang:demonitor(Mon),
            receive
                {'DOWN', Mon, process, Pid, _} -&gt; ok
            %% We were previously guaranteed to get a down message
            %% (since we exited the process ourself), so we could
            %% in this case leave out:

possibly causes the runtime system to halt has been
cleaned up, including fixing some minor bugs.</p> <p><strong>application_controller</strong> should now always terminate
with a non-nested string, meaning the slogan in an
<strong>erl_crash.dump</strong> should always be easy to read.</p> <p><strong>init</strong> now makes sure that the slogan passed to
<strong>erlang:halt/1</strong> does not exceed the maximum allowed
length.</p> <p>Redundant calls to <strong>list_to_atom/1</strong> has been removed
from the primitive <strong>error_logger</strong> event handler.

messages and crashdump file slogan.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5964</p> </li><li> <p>The <strong>erl_ddll</strong> server is now started when OTP is
started and placed under the Kernel supervisor. This
fixes several minor issues. It used to be started on
demand.</p> <p>The documentation for the <strong>start</strong> and <strong>stop</strong>
functions in the <strong>erl_ddll</strong> module has been removed,
as those functions are not meant to be used by other
applications.</p> <p>Furthermore, the <strong>erl_ddll:stop/1</strong> function no longer
terminates the <strong>erl_ddll</strong> server, as that would
terminate the entire runtime system.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-6033</p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>Removed some unused functions from

old timeout of 15 seconds could time out under very heavy
load.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5959</p> </li><li> <p>Corrected the start of code server to use reference-tagged
tuples to ensure that an unexpected message sent to
the parent process does not cause a halt of the system.

added <strong>nonode@nohost</strong> to the list of nodes to lock.
This could happen before any nodes got known to the global
name server. Depending on net configuration the symptom was
a delay.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5792 Aux Id: OTP-5563</p> </li><li> <p>If an <strong>.app</strong> file is missing, the error reason
returned by <strong>application:load/1</strong> has been corrected

instead of the less informative <strong>{"unknown POSIX error","FILE.app"}</strong>.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5809</p> </li><li> <p>Bug fixes: <strong>disk_log:accessible_logs/0</strong> no longer
reports all <strong>pg2</strong> process groups as distributed disk

and their values were not provided using
the <strong>-boot_var</strong> option, the emulator would refuse to
start with a confusing error message. Corrected to show a
clear, understandable message.</p> <p>The <strong>prim_file</strong> module was modified to not depend
on the <strong>lists</strong> module, to make it possible to start
the emulator using a user-defined loader. (Thanks to

actual error reason, instead of <strong>shutdown</strong>. This
means that the crash dump now should be somewhat more

documentation for more information.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5374</p> </li></ul><h2>Kernel 2.10.4</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>The application master for an application now terminates
the application faster, which reduces the risk for
timeouts in other parts of the system.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5363 Aux Id: EABln19084</p> </li><li> <p>A BIF <strong>erlang:raise/3</strong> has been added. See the manual
for details. It is intended for internal system programming
only, advanced error handling.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5376 Aux Id: OTP-5257</p> </li></ul><h2>Kernel 2.10.3</h2><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>With the <strong>-eval</strong> flag (<strong>erl -eval Expr</strong>), an
arbitrary expression can be evaluated during system
initialization. This is documented in <strong>init(3)</strong>.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5260</p> </li><li> <p>The unsupported and undocumented modules <strong>socks5</strong>,
<strong>socks5_auth</strong>, <strong>socks5_tcp</strong>, and <strong>socks5_udp</strong>
have been removed.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5266</p> </li></ul><h2>Kernel 2.10.1</h2><h2>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h2><ul><li> <p>The Pman 'trace shell' functionality was broken and has
now been fixed. Furthermore, Pman could not correctly
find the pid of the active shell if more than one shell
process was running on the node. This has also been
corrected.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5191</p> </li><li> <p>The documentation for the <strong>auth:open/1</strong> function
which no longer exists has been removed. (Thanks to
Miguel Barreiro.)</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5208</p> </li><li> <p>Corrected the <strong>crc32/3</strong> function in the undocumented
and unsupported <strong>zlib</strong> module.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5227</p> </li></ul><h2>Improvements and New Features</h2><ul><li> <p>You can now start Erlang with the <strong>-rsh</strong> flag which
gives you a remote initial shell instead of a local one.
Example:</p> <pre>
            erl -sname this_node -rsh other_node@other_host
          </pre> <p>Own Id: OTP-5210</p> </li><li> <p>If <strong>/etc/hosts</strong> specified two hosts with the same IP
address (on separate lines), only the last host would be
registered by inet_db during inet configuration. This has
been corrected now so that both aliases are registered
with the same IP address.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5212 Aux Id: seq7128</p> </li><li> <p>The documentation for BIFs that take I/O lists have
been clarified. Those are <strong>list_to_binary/1</strong>,
<strong>port_command/2</strong>, <strong>port_control/3</strong>.</p> <p>Documentation for all <strong>is_*</strong> BIFs (such as
<strong>is_atom/1</strong>) has been added.</p> <p>Removed the documentation for
<strong>erlang:float_to_binary/2</strong> which was removed from
the run-time system several releases ago.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5222</p> </li></ul></body></html>
