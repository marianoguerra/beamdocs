Erlang and provides tools for collection and graphical viewing of
trace data.</p><p>The viewed trace data is normally collected from Erlang trace
ports or files.</p><h2>Scope and Purpose</h2><p>This manual describes the <strong>Event Tracer (ET)</strong> application,
as a component of the Erlang/Open Telecom Platform development
environment. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the
Erlang Development Environment, which is described in a separate
User's Guide.</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>The following prerequisites is required for understanding the
material in the <strong>Event Tracer (ET)</strong> User's Guide:</p><ul><li> <p>familiarity with the Erlang system and Erlang programming
in general and the especially the art of Erlang tracing.</p> </li></ul><p>The application requires Erlang/OTP release R13BB or later. If
you use the old <strong>GS</strong> based GUI it does suffice with R7B.</p><h2>About This Manual</h2><p>In addition to this introductory chapter, the <strong>Event Tracers</strong> User's Guide contains the following chapters:</p><ul><li> <p>Chapter 2: "Tutorial" provides a walk-through of the
various parts of the application. The tutorial is based on
<strong>Jayson Vantuyl's</strong> article
<strong>http://souja.net/2009/04/making-sense-of-erlangs-event-tracer.html</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p>Chapter 3: "Description" describes the architecture and typical
usage of the application.</p> </li><li> <p>Chapter 4: "Advanced examples" gives some usage examples</p> </li></ul><h2>Where to Find More Information</h2><p>Refer to the following documentation for more information about
<strong>Event Tracer (ET)</strong> and about the Erlang/OTP development system:</p><ul><li> <p>the Reference Manual of the <strong>Event Tracer (ET)</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p>documentation of basic tracing in <strong>erlang:trace/4</strong> and
<strong>erlang:trace_pattern/3</strong> and then the utilities derived
from these: <strong>dbg</strong>, <strong>observer</strong>, <strong>invisio</strong> and
<strong>et</strong>.</p> </li><li> <p>Programming Erlang: Software for a Concurrent World by Joe
