in user applications in order to enable simplified
tracing. The functions are extremely light weight as they do
nothing besides returning an atom. The functions are designed
for being traced. The global tracing mechanism in
<strong>et_collector</strong> defaults to set its trace pattern to these
functions.</p><p>The label is intended to provide a brief summary of the
event. It is preferred to use an atom but a string would also
do.</p><p>The contents can be any term but in order to simplify
post processing of the traced events, a plain list
of {Key, Value} tuples is preferred.</p><p>Some events, such as messages, are directed from some actor to another.
Other events (termed actions) may be undirected and only have one actor.</p><h2>trace_me(DetailLevel, FromTo, Label, Contents) -&gt; hopefully_traced</h2><p>A function that is intended to be traced.</p><p>Invokes <strong>et:trace_me/5</strong> with both <strong>From</strong> and <strong>To</strong>

caller hopes that someone is listening. In other words, they
invoke <strong>et:trace_me/4</strong> and <strong>et:trace_me/5</strong>
respectively.</p><h2>report_event(DetailLevel, FromTo, Label, Contents) -&gt; hopefully_traced</h2><h2>report_event(DetailLevel, From, To, Label, Contents) -&gt; hopefully_traced</h2><p>Deprecated functions</p><p>Deprecated functions which for the time being are kept for
