are included in a release (system) based on Erlang/OTP.This file is used by the functions in 
<a href="systools">systools</a> 
when generating start scripts (<strong>.script</strong>, <strong>.boot</strong>) and 
release upgrade files (<strong>relup</strong>).</p><h2>File Syntax</h2><p>The release resource file is to be called <strong>Name.rel</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>.rel</strong> file contains one single Erlang term, which is
called a <em>release specification</em>. The file has the
following syntax:</p><pre><code class="">
