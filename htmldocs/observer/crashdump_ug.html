Erlang crashdumps.
</p><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>The easiest way to start Crashdump Viewer is to use
shell script <strong>cdv</strong> with the full path to the
Erlang crashdump as argument. The script is located in
directory <strong>priv</strong> of the Observer application. This starts the
Crashdump Viewer GUI and loads the specified file. If no filename is
specified, a file dialog is opened where the file can be
selected.</p><p>Under Windows, the batch file <strong>cdv.bat</strong> can be used.</p><p>Crashdump Viewer can also be started from
an Erlang node by calling <a href="./crashdump_viewer#start/0">crashdump_viewer:start/0</a>
or <a href="./crashdump_viewer#start/1">crashdump_viewer:start/1</a>.</p><h2>GUI</h2><p>The GUI main window is opened when Crashdump Viewer has loaded a
crashdump. It contains a title bar, a menu bar,
information tabs, and a status bar.</p><p>The title bar shows the name of the currently loaded
crashdump.</p><p>The menu bar contains a <em>File</em> menu and a <em>Help</em>
menu. From the <em>File</em> menu, a new crashdump can be loaded or 
the tool can be terminated. From the <em>Help</em> menu, this User's Guide 
and section "How to interpret the Erlang crash dumps" from the
ERTS application can be opened. "How to interpret
the Erlang crash dumps" describes the raw crashdumps in
detail and includes information about each
field in the information pages."How to interpret the Erlang crash dumps" 
is also available in the OTP online documentation.</p><p>The status bar at the bottom of the window shows a warning
if the currently loaded dump is truncated.</p><p>The center area of the main window contains the information
tabs. Each tab displays information about a specific item or a
list of items. Select a tab by clicking the tab title.</p><p>From tabs displaying lists of items, for example, the
<em>Processes</em> tab or the <em>Ports</em> tab, a new window with 
more information can be opened by double-clicking a row or by right-
clicking the row and selecting an item from the drop-down
menu. The new window is called a detail window. Detail windows can
be opened for processes, ports, nodes, and modules.</p><p>The information shown in a detail window can contain
links to processes or ports. Clicking one of these links opens
the detail window for the process or port in question. If the
process or port resides on a remote node, no
information is available. Clicking the link then displays a dialog
where you can choose to open the detail window for the
remote node.
</p><p>Some tabs contain a left-hand menu where subitems of
the information area can be selected. Click one of the
rows, and the information is displayed in the right-hand
information area.</p><h2>Tab Content</h2><p>Each tab in the main window contains an information
page. If no information is found for an item, the page is
empty. The reason for not finding information about an item
can be the following:</p><ul><li>It is a dump from an old OTP release in which this item was not written.</li><li>The item was not present in the system at the point of failure.</li><li>The dump is truncated. In this case, a warning is displayed in the status bar of the main window.</li></ul><p>Even if some information about an item exists, there can be
empty fields if the dump originates from an old OTP release.</p><p>The value <strong>-1</strong> in any field means "unknown", and in most
cases it means that the dump was truncated somewhere around this
field.</p><p>The following sections describe some of the fields in the
information tabs. These are fields that do not exist
in the raw crashdump, or in some way differ from the fields in
the raw crashdump. For details about other fields, see
the 
<a href="./users_guide">ERTS User's Guide</a>, section
"How to interpret the Erlang crash dumps". That section can also
be opened from the <em>Help</em> menu in the main window.
There are also links from the following sections to related information 
in "How to interpret the Erlang crash dumps".</p><a name="general_info"></a><h2>General Tab</h2><p>Tab <em>General</em> shows a short overview
of the dump.</p><p>The following fields are not described in the ERTS
User's Guide:</p><dl><dt><strong>Crashdump created on</strong></dt><dd><p>Time of failure.</p></dd><dt><strong>Memory allocated</strong></dt><dd><p>The total number of bytes allocated, equivalent to
<strong>c:memory(total)</strong>.</p></dd><dt><strong>Memory maximum</strong></dt><dd><p>The maximum number of bytes that has been allocated during
the lifetime of the originating node. This is only shown if
the Erlang runtime system is run instrumented.</p></dd><dt><strong>Atoms</strong></dt><dd><p>If available in the dump, this is the total number of
atoms in the atom table. If the size of the atom table is
unavailable, the number of atoms visible in the dump is
displayed.</p></dd><dt><strong>Processes</strong></dt><dd><p>The number of processes visible in the dump.</p></dd><dt><strong>ETS tables</strong></dt><dd><p>The number of ETS tables visible in the dump.</p></dd><dt><strong>Funs</strong></dt><dd><p>The number of funs visible in the dump.</p></dd></dl><p>For details, see

</p><a name="processes"></a><h2>Processes Tab</h2><p>Tab <em>Processes</em> shows a list of all processes
found in the crashdump, including brief information about
each process. By default, the processes are sorted by their
pids. To sort by another topic, click the desired column heading.</p><p>Column <em>Memory</em> shows the 'Memory' field that was
added to crashdumps in Erlang/OTP R16B01. This is the total amount of memory
used by the process. For crashdumps from earlier releases, this
column shows the 'Stack+heap' field. The value is always in bytes.</p><p>To view detailed information about a specific process, double-
click the row in the list, or right-click the row and select
<em>Properties for &lt;pid&gt;</em>.</p><p>For details, see
<a href="../erts/crash_dump#processes">Process Information</a>
in section "How to Interpret the Erlang Crash Dumps" in ERTS.
</p><a name="ports"></a><h2>Ports Tab</h2><p>Tab <em>Ports</em> is similar to the <em>Processes</em>
tab, except it lists all ports found in the crashdump.</p><p>To view more details about a specific port, double-click the row
or right-click it and select <em>Properties for &lt;port&gt;</em>. From
the right-click menu, you can also select <em>Properties for &lt;pid&gt;</em>, where <strong>&lt;pid&gt;</strong> is the process connected to the
port.</p><p>For details, see
<a href="../erts/crash_dump#ports">Port Information</a>
in section "How to Interpret the Erlang Crash Dumps" in ERTS.
</p><a name="ets_tables"></a><a name="internal_ets_tables"></a><h2>ETS Tables Tab</h2><p>Tab <em>ETS Tables</em> shows all ETS table information
found in the dump. <em>Id</em> is the same as the 'Table' field
in the raw crashdump. <em>Memory</em> is the 'Words' field from the
raw crashdump translated into bytes. For tree tables, there is
no value in the 'Objects' field.</p><p>To open the detailed information page about the table, double-
click, or right-click the row and select <em>Properties for 'Identifier'</em>.</p><p>To open the detailed information page about the owner process
of an ETS table, right-click the row and select <em>Properties for &lt;pid&gt;</em>.</p><p>For details, see
<a href="../erts/crash_dump#ets_tables">ETS Tables</a>
in section "How to Interpret the Erlang Crash Dumps" in ERTS.
</p><a name="timers"></a><h2>Timers Tab</h2><p>Tab <em>Timers</em> shows all timer information found in
the dump.</p><p>To open the detailed information page about the owner process
of a timer, right-click the row and select <em>Properties for &lt;pid&gt;</em>.</p><p>Double-clicking a row in the <em>Timers</em> tab has no effect.</p><p>For details, see
<a href="../erts/crash_dump#timers">Timers</a>
in section "How to Interpret the Erlang Crash Dumps" in ERTS.
</p><a name="schedulers"></a><h2>Schedulers Tab</h2><p>Tab <em>Schedulers</em> shows all scheduler information
found in the dump.</p><p>To open the detailed information page about the scheduler,
double-click, or right-click the row and select <em>Properties for 'Identifier'</em>.</p><p>For details, see
<a href="../erts/crash_dump#scheduler">Scheduler Information</a>
in section "How to Interpret the Erlang Crash Dumps" in ERTS.
</p><a name="funs"></a><h2>Funs Tab</h2><p>Tab <em>Funs</em> shows all fun information found in the
dump.</p><p>To open the detailed information page about the module to which
the fun belongs, right-click the row and select <em>Properties for &lt;mod&gt;</em>.</p><p>Double-clicking a row in the <em>Funs</em> tab has no effect.</p><p>For details, see
<a href="../erts/crash_dump#funs">Fun Information</a>
in section "How to Interpret the Erlang Crash Dumps" in ERTS.
</p><a name="atoms"></a><h2>Atoms Tab</h2><p>Tab <em>Atoms</em> lists all atoms found in the dump. By
default the atoms are sorted in creation order from first to
last. This is opposite of the raw crashdump where atoms are listed
from last to first, meaning that if the dump was truncated in the
middle of the atom list, only the last created atoms are visible
in the <em>Atoms</em> tab.</p><p>For details, see
<a href="../erts/crash_dump#atoms">Atoms</a>
in section "How to Interpret the Erlang Crash Dumps" in ERTS.
</p><a name="distribution_info"></a><h2>Nodes Tab</h2><p>Tab <em>Nodes</em> shows a list of all external Erlang
nodes that are referenced from the crashdump.</p><p>If the page is empty, it means either of the following:</p><ul><li>The crashed node is not distributed.</li><li>The crashed node is distributed but has no references to other nodes.</li><li>The dump is truncated.</li></ul><p>If the node is distributed, all referenced nodes are
visible. Column <em>Connection type</em> shows if the node
is visible, hidden, or not connected. Visible nodes are alive nodes
with a living connection to the originating node. Hidden nodes are
the same as visible nodes, except they are started with flag
<strong>-hidden</strong>. Not connected nodes are nodes that are not
connected to the originating node anymore, but references
(that is, process or port identifiers) exist.</p><p>To see more detailed information about a node, double-click the
row, or right-click the row and select <em>Properties for node &lt;node&gt;</em>. From the right-click menu, you can also select
<em>Properties for &lt;port&gt;</em>, to open the detailed information
window for the controlling port.</p><p>In the detailed information window for a node, any existing
links and monitors between processes on the originating node and
the connected node are displayed. <em>Extra Info</em> can contain
debug information (that is, special information written if the
emulator is debug-compiled) or error information.</p><p>For details, see

in section "How to Interpret the Erlang Crash Dumps" in ERTS.
</p><a name="loaded_modules"></a><h2>Modules Tab</h2><p>Tab <em>Modules</em> lists all modules loaded
on the originating node, and the current code size. If old
code exists, the old size is also shown.</p><p>To view detailed information about a specific module, double-
click the row, or right-click it and select <em>Properties for &lt;mod&gt;</em>.</p><p>For details, see
