interpreter, which can be used for debugging and testing of
Erlang programs. For example, breakpoints can be set, code can be
single-stepped and variable values can be displayed and changed.
</p><p>The Erlang interpreter can also be accessed through the interface
module <a href="int">int</a>.
</p><div class="alert alert-warning"><h4 class="alert-heading">Warning</h4><p>Debugger might at some point
start tracing on the processes that execute the interpreted
code. This means that a conflict occurs if tracing by other
means is started on any of these processes.</p></div><h3>Prerequisites</h3><p>It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the Erlang
programming language.</p><p>Modules to be debugged must include debug information,
for example, <strong>erlc +debug_info MODULE.erl</strong>.</p><h3>Getting Started</h3><p>To use Debugger, the basic steps are as follows:</p><p><em>Step 1.</em> Start Debugger by calling
<strong>debugger:start()</strong>.</p><p>The <a href="#monitor">Monitor window</a> is
displayed with information about all debugged processes,
interpreted modules, and selected options. Initially there are
normally no debugged processes. First, it must be specified which
modules that are to be <em>debugged</em> (also called
<em>interpreted</em>). Proceed as follows:</p><p><em>Step 2.</em> Select <em>Module &gt; Interpret...</em> in the
Monitor window.</p><p>The <a href="#interpret">Interpret Modules window</a>
is displayed.</p><p><em>Step 3.</em> Select the appropriate modules from the Interpret
Dialog window.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>Only modules compiled with option <strong>debug_info</strong> set can be
interpreted. Non-interpretable modules are displayed within
parenthesis in the Interpret Modules window.</p></div><p><em>Step 4.</em> In the Monitor window, select
<em>Module &gt; the module to be interpreted &gt; View</em>.</p><p>The contents of the source file is displayed in the
<a href="#view">View Module window</a>.</p><p><em>Step 5.</em> Set the
<a href="#breakpoints">breakpoints</a>, if any.</p><p><em>Step 6.</em> Start the program to be debugged. This is done
the normal way from the Erlang shell.</p><p>All processes executing code in interpreted modules are displayed
in the Monitor window.</p><p><em>Step 7.</em> To <em>attach</em> to one of these processes,
double-click it, or select the process and then choose
<em>Process &gt; Attach</em>. Attaching to a process opens an
<a href="#attach">Attach Process window</a> for this
process.</p><p><em>Step 8.</em> From the Attach Process window, you can control
the process execution, inspect variable values, set breakpoints,
and so on.</p><a name="breakpoints"></a><h3>Breakpoints and Break Dialog Windows</h3><p>Once the appropriate modules are interpreted, breakpoints can
be set at relevant locations in the source code. Breakpoints are
specified on a line basis. When a process reaches a breakpoint,
it stops and waits for commands (<em>Step</em>, <em>Skip</em>,
<em>Continue</em> ...) from the user.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>When a process reaches a breakpoint, only that process is
stopped. Other processes are not affected.</p></div><p>Breakpoints are created and deleted using the <em>Break</em> menu of
either the Monitor window, View Module window, or Attach Process
window.</p><h3>Executable Lines</h3><p>To have an effect, a breakpoint must be set at an
<em>executable line</em>, which is a line of code containing an
executable expression such as a matching or a function call.
A blank line or a line containing a comment, function head, or
pattern in a <strong>case</strong> statement or <strong>receive</strong> statement is not
executable.</p><p>In the following example, lines 2, 4, 6, 8, and 11 are
executable lines:</p><pre>
1: is_loaded(Module,Compiled) -&gt;
2:   case get_file(Module,Compiled) of
3:     {ok,File} -&gt;
4:       case code:which(Module) of
5:         ?TAG -&gt;
6:           {loaded,File};
7:         _ -&gt;
8:           unloaded
9:       end;
10:    false -&gt;
11:      false
12:  end.</pre><h3>Status and Trigger Action</h3><p>A breakpoint can be either <em>active</em> or
<em>inactive</em>. Inactive breakpoints are ignored.</p><p>Each breakpoint has a <em>trigger action</em> that specifies
what is to happen when a process has reached it (and stopped):</p><ul><li><em>Enable</em> - Breakpoint is to remain active (default). </li><li><em>Disable</em> - Breakpoint is to be made inactive.</li><li><em>Delete</em> - Breakpoint is to be deleted.</li></ul><h3>Line Breakpoints</h3><p>A line breakpoint is created at a certain line in a module.</p><img src="images/line_break_dialog.jpg" title="Line Break Dialog Window"></img><p>Right-click the <em>Module</em> entry to open a popup menu from
which the appropriate module can be selected.</p><p>A line breakpoint can also be created (and deleted) by
double-clicking the line when the module is displayed in
the View Module window or Attach Process window.</p><h3>Conditional Breakpoints</h3><p>A conditional breakpoint is created at a certain line in
the module, but a process reaching the breakpoint stops
only if a specified condition is true.</p><p>The condition is specified by the user as a module name
<strong>CModule</strong> and a function name <strong>CFunction</strong>. When a
process reaches the breakpoint,
<strong>CModule:CFunction(Bindings)</strong> is evaluated. If and
only if this function call returns <strong>true</strong>, the process
stops. If the function call returns <strong>false</strong>,
the breakpoint is silently ignored.</p><p><strong>Bindings</strong> is a list of variable bindings. To retrieve the
value of <strong>Variable</strong> (given as an atom), use function
<a href="./int#get_binding/2">int#get_binding/2</a>.
The function returns <strong>unbound</strong> or <strong>{value,Value}</strong>.</p><img src="images/cond_break_dialog.jpg" title="Conditional Break Dialog Window"></img><p>Right-click the <em>Module</em> entry to open a popup menu from
which the appropriate module can be selected.</p><p><em>Example:</em></p><p>A conditional breakpoint calling
<strong>c_test:c_break/1</strong> is added at line 6 in module
<strong>fact</strong>. Each time the breakpoint is reached, the function is
called. When <strong>N</strong> is equal to 3, the function returns
<strong>true</strong> and the process stops.</p><p>Extract from <strong>fact.erl</strong>:</p><pre>
5. fac(0) -&gt; 1;
6. fac(N) when N &gt; 0, is_integer(N) -&gt; N * fac(N-1).</pre><p>Definition of <strong>c_test:c_break/1</strong>:</p><pre>
-module(c_test).
-export([c_break/1]).

c_break(Bindings) -&gt;
    case int:get_binding('N', Bindings) of
        {value, 3} -&gt;
            true;
        _ -&gt;
            false
    end.</pre><h3>Function Breakpoints</h3><p>A function breakpoint is a set of line breakpoints, one at
the first line of each clause in the specified function.</p><img src="images/function_break_dialog.jpg" title="Function Break Dialog Window"></img><p>To open a popup menu from which the appropriate module can be
selected, right-click the <em>Module</em> entry.</p><p>To bring up all functions of the module in the listbox,
click the <em>OK</em> button (or press the <em>Return</em>
or <em>Tab</em> key) when a module name has been specified,.</p><a name="stack_trace"></a><h3>Stack Trace</h3><p>The Erlang emulator keeps track of a <em>stack trace</em>,
information about recent function calls. This information is
used if an error occurs, for example:</p><pre>
1&gt; <span class="input">catch a+1.</span>
{'EXIT',{badarith,[{erlang,'+',[a,1],[]},
                   {erl_eval,do_apply,6,[{file,"erl_eval.erl"},{line,573}]},
                   {erl_eval,expr,5,[{file,"erl_eval.erl"},{line,357}]},
                   {shell,exprs,7,[{file,"shell.erl"},{line,674}]},
                   {shell,eval_exprs,7,[{file,"shell.erl"},{line,629}]},
                   {shell,eval_loop,3,[{file,"shell.erl"},{line,614}]}]}}</pre><p>For details about the stack trace, see section
<a href="./errors">Errors and Error Handling</a>
in the Erlang Reference Manual.</p><p>Debugger emulates the stack trace by keeping track of recently
called interpreted functions. (The real stack trace cannot be
used, as it shows which functions of Debugger have been
called, rather than which interpreted functions.)</p><p>This information can be used to traverse the chain of function
calls, using the <em>Up</em> and <em>Down</em> buttons in the
<a href="#attach">Attach Process window</a>.</p><p>By default, Debugger only saves information about recursive
function calls, that is, function calls that have not yet returned
a value (option <em>Stack On, No Tail</em>).</p><p>Sometimes, however, it can be useful to save all calls, even
tail-recursive calls. This is done with option
<em>Stack On, Tail</em>. Notice that this option consumes more
memory and slows down execution of interpreted functions when there
are many tail-recursive calls.</p><p>To turn off the Debugger stack trace facility, select option
<em>Stack Off</em>.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>If an error occurs, the stack trace becomes empty in this
case.</p></div><p>For information about how to change the stack trace option, see

to interpret. Initially, the window displays the modules (<strong>erl</strong>
files) and subdirectories of the current working directory.</p><p>Interpretable modules are modules for which a <strong>.beam</strong> file,
compiled with option <strong>debug_info</strong> set, is located in the same
directory as the source code, or in an <strong>ebin</strong> directory next
to it.</p><p>Modules for which these requirements are not fulfilled are
not interpretable and are therefore displayed within parentheses.</p><p>Option <strong>debug_info</strong> causes <em>debug information</em> or
<em>abstract code</em> to be added to the <strong>.beam</strong> file.
This increases the file size and makes it possible to
reconstruct the source code. It is therefore recommended not to
include debug information in code aimed for target systems.</p><p>An example of how to compile code with debug information using
<strong>erlc</strong>:</p><pre>
% erlc +debug_info module.erl</pre><p>An example of how to compile code with debug information from
the Erlang shell:</p><pre>
4&gt; c(module, debug_info).</pre><img src="images/interpret.jpg" title="Interpret Modules Window"></img><p>To browse the file hierarchy and interpret the appropriate modules,
either select a module name and click <em>Choose</em> (or
press carriage return), or double-click the module name.
Interpreted modules have the type <strong>erl src</strong>.</p><p>To interpret all displayed modules in the chosen directory, click
<em>All</em>.</p><p>To close the window, click <em>Done</em>.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>When Debugger is started in global mode (which is the default, see
<a href="./debugger#start/0">debugger:start/0</a>),
modules added (or deleted) for interpretation are added (or
deleted) on all known Erlang nodes.</p></div><a name="attach"></a><h3>Attach Process Window</h3><p>From an Attach Process window, you can interact with a
debugged process. One window is opened for each process that has
been attached to. Notice that when attaching to a process, its
execution is automatically stopped.</p><img src="images/attach.jpg" title="Attach Process Window"></img><p>The window is divided into the following five parts:</p><ul><li><p>The Code area, displaying the code being executed. The code
is indented and each line is prefixed with its line number.
If the process execution is stopped, the current line is
marked with <strong>--&gt;</strong>. An existing break point at a line
is marked with a stop symbol. In the example shown in the
illustration, the execution stopped at line 6, before
the execution of <strong>fac/1</strong>.</p> <p>Active breakpoints are displayed in red and inactive
breakpoints in blue.</p> </li><li><p>The Button area, with buttons for quick access to frequently
used functions in the <em>Process</em> menu.</p></li><li><p>The Evaluator area, where you can evaluate functions
within the context of the debugged process, if that
process execution is stopped.</p></li><li><p>The Bindings area, displaying all variables bindings. If you
click a variable name, the value is displayed in the Evaluator area.
Double-click a variable name to open a window where
the variable value can be edited. Notice however that pid, port,
reference, or fun
values cannot be edited unless they can be represented in the
running system.</p> </li><li><p>The Trace area, which displays a trace output for the
process.</p> <dl><dt><strong>++ (N) &lt;L&gt;</strong></dt><dd><p>Function call, where <strong>N</strong> is the call level and
<strong>L</strong> the line number.</p></dd><dt><strong>-- (N)</strong></dt><dd><p>Function return value</p>.</dd><dt><strong>==&gt; Pid : Msg</strong></dt><dd><p>The message <strong>Msg</strong> is sent to process

current function calls on the stack.</p> </li></ul><p>Using the <em>Options</em> menu, you can set which areas to be
displayed. By default, all areas except the Trace area are displayed.</p><h3>File Menu</h3><dl><dt><em>Close</em></dt><dd><p>Closes this window and detach from the process.</p> </dd></dl><h3>Edit Menu</h3><dl><dt><em>Go to line...</em></dt><dd><p>Goes to a specified line number.</p></dd><dt><em>Search...</em></dt><dd><p>Searches for a specified string.</p></dd></dl><h3>Process Menu</h3><dl><dt><em>Step</em></dt><dd><p>Executes the current code line, stepping into any

are the same as in the
<a href="#monitor">Monitor Window</a>, except
that the <em>Breaks</em> menu applies only to local
breakpoints.</p><a name="view"></a><h3>View Module Window</h3><p>The View Module window displays the contents of an interpreted
module and makes it possible to set breakpoints.</p><img src="images/view.jpg" title="View Module Window"></img><p>The source code is indented and each line is prefixed with its
line number.</p><p>Clicking a line highlights it and selects it to be the target
of the breakpoint functions available from the <em>Break</em> menu.
To set a line breakpoint on a line, double-click it.
To remove the breakpoint, double-click the line with an existing
breakpoint.</p><p>Breakpoints are marked with a stop symbol.</p><h3>File and Edit Menus</h3><p>The <em>File</em> and <em>Edit</em> menus are the same as in the
<a href="#attach">Attach Process Window</a>.</p><h3>Break, Windows, and Help Menus</h3><p>The <em>Break</em>, <em>Windows</em>, and <em>Help</em> menus
are the same as in the
<a href="#monitor">Monitor Window</a>, except
that the <em>Break</em> menu applies only to local breakpoints.</p><h3>Performance</h3><p>Execution of interpreted code is naturally slower than for
regularly compiled modules. Using Debugger also increases
the number of processes in the system, as for each debugged
process another process (the meta process) is created.</p><p>It is also worth to keep in mind that programs with timers can
behave differently when debugged. This is especially true when
stopping the execution of a process (for example, at a
breakpoint). Time-outs can then occur in other processes that
continue execution as normal.</p><h3>Code Loading Mechanism</h3><p>Code loading works almost as usual, except that interpreted
modules are also stored in a database and debugged processes
use only this stored code. Reinterpreting an interpreted
module results in the new version being stored as well, but
does not affect existing processes executing an older version
of the code. This means that the code replacement mechanism of
Erlang does not work for debugged processes.</p><h3>Debugging Remote Nodes</h3><p>By using
<a href="./debugger#start/1">debugger:start/1</a>,
you can specify if Debugger is to be started in local or global
mode:</p><pre>
debugger:start(local | global)</pre><p>If no argument is provided, Debugger starts in global mode.</p><p>In local mode, code is interpreted only at the current node.
In global mode, code is interpreted at all known nodes. Processes
at other nodes executing interpreted code are automatically
displayed in the Monitor window and can be attached to like any other
debugged process.</p><p>It is possible, but definitely not recommended, to start Debugger
in global mode on more than one node in a network, as the nodes
interfere with each other, leading to inconsistent behavior.</p></body></html>
