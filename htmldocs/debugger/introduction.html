interpreter, which can be used for debugging and testing of
Erlang programs. For example, breakpoints can be set, code can be
single-stepped and variable values can be displayed and changed.
</p><p>The Erlang interpreter can also be accessed through the interface
module <a href="int">int</a>.
</p><div class="alert alert-warning"><h4 class="alert-heading">Warning</h4><p>Debugger might at some point
start tracing on the processes that execute the interpreted
code. This means that a conflict occurs if tracing by other
means is started on any of these processes.</p></div><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the Erlang
programming language.</p><p>Modules to be debugged must include debug information,
for example, <strong>erlc +debug_info MODULE.erl</strong>.</p></body></html>
