about a process terminating because of an uncaught error exception,
is by default written to terminal (tty):</p><pre><code class="">
=ERROR REPORT==== 9-Dec-2003::13:25:02 ===
Error in process &lt;0.27.0&gt; with exit value: {{badmatch,[1,2,3]},[{m,f,1},{shell,eval_loop,2}]}</code></pre><p>The error information is handled by Logger, which is part of
the Kernel application.</p><p>The exit reasons (such as <strong>badarg</strong>) used by
the runtime system are described in
<a href="../doc/reference_manual/errors#exit_reasons"> Errors and Error Handling</a>.</p><p>For information about Logger and its user
interface, see the
<a href="./logger">logger(3)</a>
manual page and
the <a href="./logger_chapter">Logging</a>
section in the Kernel User's Guide. The system can be configured so that
log events are
written to file or to tty, or both. In addition, user-defined
applications can send and format log events using
Logger.</p><h2>Log events from OTP behaviours</h2><p>The standard behaviours (<strong>supervisor</strong>, <strong>gen_server</strong>,
and so on) send progress and error information to
Logger. Progress reports are by default not logged, but can be
enabled by setting the primary log level to <strong>info</strong>, for
example by using the Kernel configuration
parameter <strong>logger_level</strong>. Supervisor reports, crash reports
and other error and information reports are by default logged
through the log handler which is set up when the Kernel
application is started.</p><p>Prior to Erlang/OTP 21.0, supervisor, crash, and progress
reports were only logged when the SASL application was
running. This behaviour can, for backwards compatibility, be
enabled by setting the Kernel configuration
parameter <a href="../kernel/kernel_app#logger_sasl_compatible">kernel/kernel_app#logger_sasl_compatible</a>
to <strong>true</strong>. For more information, see
<a href="./error_logging">SASL Error Logging</a>
in the SASL User's Guide.</p><pre>
