This section is to be read with the
<a href="./gen_statem">stdlib/gen_statem</a>
manual page in STDLIB, where all interface functions and callback
functions are described in detail.
</p><a name="Event-Driven State Machines"></a><h2>Event-Driven State Machines</h2><p>
Established Automata Theory does not deal much with
how a <em>state transition</em> is triggered,
but assumes that the output is a function
of the input (and the state) and that they are
some kind of values.
</p><p>
For an Event-Driven State Machine, the input is an event
that triggers a <em>state transition</em> and the output
is actions executed during the <em>state transition</em>.
It can analogously to the mathematical model of a
Finite State Machine be described as
a set of relations of the following form:
</p><pre>
State(S) x Event(E) -&gt; Actions(A), State(S')</pre><p>
These relations are interpreted as follows:
if we are in state <strong>S</strong> and event <strong>E</strong> occurs, we
are to perform actions <strong>A</strong> and make a transition to
state <strong>S'</strong>. Notice that <strong>S'</strong> can be equal to <strong>S</strong>
and that <strong>A</strong> can be empty.
</p><p>
In <strong>gen_statem</strong> we define
a <em>state change</em> as a <em>state transition</em>
in which the new state <strong>S'</strong> is different from
the current state <strong>S</strong>, where "different" means
Erlang's strict inequality: <strong>=/=</strong>
also know as "does not match".
During a <em>state changes</em>,
<strong>gen_statem</strong> does more things
than during other <em>state transitions</em>.
</p><p>
As <strong>A</strong> and <strong>S'</strong> depend only on
<strong>S</strong> and <strong>E</strong>, the kind of state machine described
here is a Mealy machine
(see, for example, the Wikipedia article "Mealy machine").
</p><p>
Like most <strong>gen_</strong> behaviors, <strong>gen_statem</strong> keeps
a server <strong>Data</strong> besides the state. Because of this, and as
there is no restriction on the number of states
(assuming that there is enough virtual machine memory)
or on the number of distinct input events,
a state machine implemented with this behavior
is in fact Turing complete.
But it feels mostly like an Event-Driven Mealy machine.
</p><a name="When to use gen_statem"></a><h2>When to use gen_statem</h2><p>
If your process logic is convenient to describe as a state machine,
and you want any of these <strong>gen_statem</strong> key features:
</p><ul><li> Co-located callback code for each state, for all <a href="#Event Types">Event Types</a> (such as <em>call</em>, <em>cast</em> and <em>info</em>) </li><li> <a href="#Postponing Events"> Postponing Events </a> (a substitute for selective receive) </li><li> <a href="#Inserted Events"> Inserted Events </a> that is: events from the state machine to itself (in particular purely internal events) </li><li> <a href="#State Enter Calls">State Enter Calls</a> (callback on state entry co-located with the rest of each state's callback code) </li><li> Easy-to-use time-outs (<a href="#State Time-Outs">State Time-Outs</a>, <a href="#Event Time-Outs">Event Time-Outs</a> and <a href="#Generic Time-Outs">Generic Time-outs</a> (named time-outs)) </li></ul><p>
If so, or if possibly needed in future versions,
then you should consider using <strong>gen_statem</strong> over
<a href="./gen_server">stdlib/gen_server</a>.
</p><p>
For simple state machines not needing these features
<a href="./gen_server">stdlib/gen_server</a>
works just fine.
It also has got smaller call overhead,
but we are talking about something like 2 vs 3.3 microseconds
call roundtrip time here, so if the server callback
does just a little bit more than just replying,
or if the call is not extremely frequent,
that difference will be hard to notice.
</p><a name="Callback Module"></a><h2>Callback Module</h2><p>
The <em>callback module</em> contains functions that implement
the state machine.
When an event occurs,
the <strong>gen_statem</strong> behaviour engine
calls a function in the <em>callback module</em> with the event,
current state and server data.
This function performs the actions for this event,
and returns the new state and server data
and also actions to be performed by the behaviour engine.
</p><p>
The behaviour engine holds the state machine state,
server data, timer references, a queue of posponed messages
and other metadata.  It receives all process messages,
handles the system messages, and calls the <em>callback module</em>
with machine specific events.
</p><a name="Callback Modes"></a><h2>Callback Modes</h2><p>
The <strong>gen_statem</strong> behavior supports two <em>callback modes</em>:
</p><dl><dt> <a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-callback_mode">stdlib/gen_statem#type-callback_mode</a> </dt><dd> <p>
Events are handled by one callback function per state.
</p> </dd><dt> <a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-callback_mode">stdlib/gen_statem#type-callback_mode</a> </dt><dd> <p>
Events are handled by one single callback function.
</p> </dd></dl><p>
The <em>callback mode</em> is selected at server start
and may be changed with a code upgrade/downgrade.
</p><p>
See the section
<a href="#State Callback">State Callback</a>
that describes the event handling callback function(s).
</p><p>
The <em>callback mode</em> is selected by implementing
a mandatory callback function
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#Module:callback_mode/0">stdlib/gen_statem#Module:callback_mode/0</a>
that returns one of the <em>callback modes</em>.
</p><p>
The
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#Module:callback_mode/0">stdlib/gen_statem#Module:callback_mode/0</a>
function may also return a list containing the <em>callback mode</em>
and the atom <strong>state_enter</strong> in which case
<a href="#State Enter Calls">State Enter Calls</a>
are activated for the <em>callback mode</em>.
</p><a name="Choosing the Callback Mode"></a><h2>Choosing the Callback Mode</h2><p>
The short version: choose <strong>state_functions</strong> -
it is the one most like <strong>gen_fsm</strong>.
But if you do not want the restriction that the state
must be an atom, or if you do not want to write
one <em>state callback</em> function per state; please read on...
</p><p>
The two
<a href="#Callback Modes">Callback Modes</a>
give different possibilities and restrictions,
with one common goal:
to handle all possible combinations of events and states.
</p><p>
This can be done, for example, by focusing on one state at the time
and for every state ensure that all events are handled.
Alternatively, you can focus on one event at the time
and ensure that it is handled in every state.
You can also use a mix of these strategies.
</p><p>
With <strong>state_functions</strong>, you are restricted to use
atom-only states, and the <strong>gen_statem</strong> engine
branches depending on state name for you.
This encourages the <em>callback module</em> to co-locate
the implementation of all event actions particular
to one state in the same place in the code,
hence to focus on one state at the time.
</p><p>
This mode fits well when you have a regular state diagram,
like the ones in this chapter, which describes all events and actions
belonging to a state visually around that state,
and each state has its unique name.
</p><p>
With <strong>handle_event_function</strong>, you are free to mix strategies,
as all events and states are handled in the same callback function.
</p><p>
This mode works equally well when you want to focus on
one event at the time or on
one state at the time, but function
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#Module:handle_event/4">stdlib/gen_statem#Module:handle_event/4</a>
quickly grows too large to handle without branching to
helper functions.
</p><p>
The mode enables the use of non-atom states, for example,
complex states or even hierarchical states.
See section
<a href="#Complex State">Complex State</a>.
If, for example, a state diagram is largely alike
for the client side and the server side of a protocol,
you can have a state <strong>{StateName,server}</strong> or
<strong>{StateName,client}</strong>,
and make <strong>StateName</strong> determine where in the code
to handle most events in the state.
The second element of the tuple is then used to select
whether to handle special client-side or server-side events.
</p><a name="State Callback"></a><h2>State Callback</h2><p>
The <em>state callback</em> is the callback function
that handles an event in the current state,
and which function that is depends on the <em>callback mode</em>:
</p><dl><dt><strong>state_functions</strong></dt><dd> The event is handled by:<br/> <a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#Module:StateName/3">stdlib/gen_statem#Module:StateName/3</a> <p>
This form is the one mostly used in the
<a href="#Example">Example</a>
section.
</p> </dd><dt><strong>handle_event_function</strong></dt><dd> The event is handled by:<br/> <a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#Module:handle_event/4">stdlib/gen_statem#Module:handle_event/4</a> <p>
See section
<a href="#One State Callback">One State Callback</a>
for an example.
</p> </dd></dl><p>
The state is either the name of the function itself or an argument to it.
The other arguments are the <strong>EventType</strong> described in section
<a href="#Event Types">Event Types</a>,
the event dependent <strong>EventContent</strong>,
and the current server <strong>Data</strong>.
</p><p>
<em>State enter calls</em> are also handled by the event handler
and have slightly different arguments. See section
<a href="#State Enter Calls">State Enter Calls</a>.
</p><p>
The <em>state callback</em> return values
are defined in the description of
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#Module:StateName/3">stdlib/gen_statem#Module:StateName/3</a>
in the <strong>gen_statem</strong> manual page, but here is
a more readable list:
</p><dl><dt> <strong>{next_state, NextState, NewData, Actions}</strong><br/> <strong>{next_state, NextState, NewData}</strong> </dt><dd> <p>
Set next state and update the server data.
If the <strong>Actions</strong> field is used,
execute <em>transition actions</em>.
An empty <strong>Actions</strong> list is equivalent to
not returning the field.
</p> <p>
See section
<a href="#Transition Actions">Transition Actions</a>
for a list of possible
<em>transition actions</em>.
</p> <p>
If <strong>NextState =/= State</strong> this is a <em>state change</em>
so the extra things <strong>gen_statem</strong> does are: the event queue
is restarted from the oldest
<a href="#Postponing Events">postponed event</a>,
any current
<a href="#State Time-Outs">state time-out</a>
is cancelled, and a
<a href="#State Enter Calls">state enter call</a>
is performed, if enabled.
</p> </dd><dt> <strong>{keep_state, NewData, Actions}</strong><br/> <strong>{keep_state, NewData}</strong> </dt><dd> <p>
Same as the <strong>next_state</strong> values with
<strong>NextState =:= State</strong>, that is, no <em>state change</em>.
</p> </dd><dt> <strong>{keep_state_and_data, Actions}</strong><br/> <strong>keep_state_and_data</strong> </dt><dd> <p>
Same as the <strong>keep_state</strong> values with
<strong>NextData =:= Data</strong>, that is, no change in server data.
</p> </dd><dt> <strong>{repeat_state, NewData, Actions}</strong><br/> <strong>{repeat_state, NewData}</strong><br/> <strong>{repeat_state_and_data, Actions}</strong><br/> <strong>repeat_state_and_data</strong> </dt><dd> <p>
Same as the <strong>keep_state</strong> or <strong>keep_state_and_data</strong> values,
and if
<a href="#State Enter Calls"> State Enter Calls </a>
are enabled, repeat the <em>state enter call</em>
as if this state was entered again.
</p> <p>
If these return values are used from a
<em>state enter call</em> the <strong>OldState</strong> does not change,
but if used from an event handling <em>state callback</em>
the new <em>state enter call's</em> <strong>OldState</strong>
will be the current state.
</p> </dd><dt> <strong>{stop, Reason, NewData}</strong><br/> <strong>{stop, Reason}</strong> </dt><dd> <p>
Stop the server with reason <strong>Reason</strong>.
If the <strong>NewData</strong> field is used, first update the server data.
</p> </dd><dt> <strong>{stop_and_reply, Reason, NewData, ReplyActions}</strong><br/> <strong>{stop_and_reply, Reason, ReplyActions}</strong> </dt><dd> <p>
Same as the <strong>stop</strong> values, but first execute the given
<a href="#Transition Actions">Transition Actions</a>
that may only be reply actions.
</p> </dd></dl><a name="The First State"></a><h2>The First State</h2><p>
To decide the first state the
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#Module:init/1">stdlib/gen_statem#Module:init/1</a>
callback function is called before any
<a href="#State Callback">State Callback</a>
is called.  This function behaves like an <em>state callback</em>
function, but gets its only argument <strong>Args</strong> from 
the <strong>gen_statem</strong>
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#start/3">stdlib/gen_statem#start/3</a>
or
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#start_link/3">stdlib/gen_statem#start_link/3</a>
function, and returns <strong>{ok, State, Data}</strong>
or <strong>{ok, State, Data, Actions}</strong>.
If you use the
<a href="#Postponing Events">Postponing Events</a>
action from this function, that action is ignored,
since there is no event	to postpone.
</p><a name="Transition Actions"></a><h2>Transition Actions</h2><p>
In the first section
<a href="#Event-Driven State Machines"> Event-Driven State Machines </a>
actions were mentioned as a part of
the general state machine model. These general actions
are implemented with the code that <em>callback module</em>
<strong>gen_statem</strong> executes in an event-handling
callback function before returning
to the <strong>gen_statem</strong> engine.
</p><p>
There are more specific <em>transition actions</em>
that a callback function can command the <strong>gen_statem</strong>
engine to do after the callback function return.
These are commanded by returning a list of
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-action">actions</a>
in the
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-state_callback_result"> return value </a>
from the
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#Module:StateName/3">callback function</a>.
These are the possible <em>transition actions</em>:
</p><dl><dt> <a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-postpone">stdlib/gen_statem#type-postpone</a> <br/> <strong>{postpone, Boolean}</strong> </dt><dd> If set postpone the current event, see section <a href="#Postponing Events">Postponing Events</a>. </dd><dt> <a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-hibernate">stdlib/gen_statem#type-hibernate</a> <br/> <strong>{hibernate, Boolean}</strong> </dt><dd> If set hibernate the <strong>gen_statem</strong>, treated in section <a href="#Hibernation">Hibernation</a>. </dd><dt> <a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-state_timeout">stdlib/gen_statem#type-state_timeout</a> <br/> <strong>{state_timeout, EventContent, Time, Opts}</strong> </dt><dd> Start a state time-out, read more in sections <a href="#Time-Outs">Time-Outs</a> and <a href="#State Time-Outs">State Time-Outs</a>. </dd><dt> <a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-generic_timeout">stdlib/gen_statem#type-generic_timeout</a> <br/> <strong>{{timeout, Name}, EventContent, Time, Opts}</strong> </dt><dd> Start a generic time-out, read more in sections <a href="#Time-Outs">Time-Outs</a> and <a href="#Generic Time-Outs">Generic Time-Outs</a>. </dd><dt> <a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-event_timeout">stdlib/gen_statem#type-event_timeout</a> <br/> <strong>{timeout, EventContent, Time, Opts}</strong><br/> <strong>Time</strong> </dt><dd> Start an event time-out, see more in sections <a href="#Time-Outs">Time-Outs</a> and <a href="#Event Time-Outs">Event Time-Outs</a>. </dd><dt> <a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-reply_action">stdlib/gen_statem#type-reply_action</a> </dt><dd> Reply to a caller, mentioned at the end of section <a href="#All State Events">All State Events</a>. </dd><dt> <a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-action">stdlib/gen_statem#type-action</a> </dt><dd> Generate the next event to handle, see section  <a href="#Inserted Events">Inserted Events</a>. </dd></dl><p>
For details, see the <strong>gen_statem(3)</strong>
manual page for type
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-action">stdlib/gen_statem#type-action</a>.
You can, for example, reply to many callers,
generate multiple next events,
and set a time-out to use absolute instead of relative time
(using the <strong>Opts</strong> field).
</p><a name="Event Types"></a><h2>Event Types</h2><p>
Events are categorized in different
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-event_type">stdlib/gen_statem#type-event_type</a>.
Events of all types are for a given state
handled in the same callback function, and that function gets
<strong>EventType</strong> and <strong>EventContent</strong> as arguments.
</p><p>
The following is a complete list of <em>event types</em> and where
they come from:
</p><dl><dt> <a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-external_event_type">stdlib/gen_statem#type-external_event_type</a> </dt><dd> Generated by <a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#cast/2">stdlib/gen_statem#cast/2</a>. </dd><dt> <a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-external_event_type">stdlib/gen_statem#type-external_event_type</a> </dt><dd> Generated by <a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#call/2">stdlib/gen_statem#call/2</a>, where <strong>From</strong> is the reply address to use when replying either through the <em>transition action</em> <strong>{reply,From,Msg}</strong> or by calling <a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#reply/1">stdlib/gen_statem#reply/1</a>. </dd><dt> <a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-external_event_type">stdlib/gen_statem#type-external_event_type</a> </dt><dd> Generated by any regular process message sent to the <strong>gen_statem</strong> process. </dd><dt> <a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-timeout_event_type">stdlib/gen_statem#type-timeout_event_type</a> </dt><dd> Generated by <em>transition action</em> <a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-timeout_action">stdlib/gen_statem#type-timeout_action</a> state timer timing out.

All <em>event types</em> above can also be generated using the <strong>next_event</strong> action: <strong>{next_event,EventType,EventContent}</strong>. </dd></dl><a name="State Enter Calls"></a><h2>State Enter Calls</h2><p>
The <strong>gen_statem</strong> behavior can if this is enabled,
regardless of <em>callback mode</em>,
automatically
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-state_enter"> call the state callback </a>
with special arguments whenever the state changes
so you can write state enter actions
near the rest of the <em>state transition</em> rules.
It typically looks like this:
</p><pre>
StateName(enter, OldState, Data) -&gt;
    ... code for state enter actions here ...
    {keep_state, NewData};
StateName(EventType, EventContent, Data) -&gt;
    ... code for actions here ...
    {next_state, NewStateName, NewData}.</pre><p>
Since the <em>state enter call</em> is not an event there are restrictions
on the allowed return value and
<a href="#Transition Actions">State Transition Actions</a>.
You may not change the state,
<a href="#Postponing Events">postpone</a>
this non-event, or
<a href="#Inserted Events">insert any events</a>.
</p><p>
The first state that is entered
will get a <em>state enter call</em>
with <strong>OldState</strong> equal to the current state.
</p><p>
You may repeat the <em>state enter call</em>
using the <strong>{repeat_state,...}</strong>
return value from the 
<a href="#State Callback">state callback</a>.
In this case <strong>OldState</strong> will also be equal to the current state.
</p><p>
Depending on how your state machine is specified,
this can be a very useful feature, but it forces you to handle
the <em>state enter calls</em> in all states.
See also the
<a href="#State Enter Actions"> State Enter Actions </a>
section.
</p><a name="Time-Outs"></a><h2>Time-outs</h2><p>
Time-outs in <strong>gen_statem</strong> are started from a
<a href="#Transition Actions">Transition Actions</a>
during a state transition that is when exiting from the
<a href="#State Callback">State Callback</a>.
</p><p>
There are 3 types of time-outs in <strong>gen_statem</strong>:
</p><dl><dt> <a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-state_timeout">stdlib/gen_statem#type-state_timeout</a> </dt><dd> There is one <a href="#State Time-Outs">State Time-Out</a> that is automatically cancelled by a <em>state change</em>. </dd><dt> <a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-generic_timeout">stdlib/gen_statem#type-generic_timeout</a> </dt><dd> There are any number of <a href="#Generic Time-Outs">Generic Time-Outs</a> differing by their <strong>Name</strong>. They have no automatic cancelling. </dd><dt> <a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-event_timeout">stdlib/gen_statem#type-event_timeout</a> </dt><dd> There is one <a href="#Event Time-Outs">Event Time-Out</a> that is automatically cancelled by any event. Note that <a href="#Postponing Events">postponed </a> and <a href="#Inserted Events">inserted</a> events cancel this timeout just as external events. </dd></dl><p>
When a time-out is started any running time-out with the same tag,
<strong>state_timeout</strong>, <strong>{timeout, Name}</strong> or <strong>timeout</strong>,
is cancelled, that is the time-out is restarted with the new time.
</p><p>
All time-outs has got an <strong>EventContent</strong> that is part of the
<a href="#Transition Actions">Transition Actions</a>
that starts the time-out.
Different <strong>EventContent</strong>s does not create different time-outs.
The <strong>EventContent</strong> is delivered to the
<a href="#State Callback">State Callback</a>
when the time-out expires.
</p><a name="Cancelling a Time-Out"></a><h2>Cancelling a Time-Out</h2><p>
If a time-out is started with the time <strong>infinity</strong> it will
never time out, in fact it will not even be started, and any
running time-out with the same tag will be cancelled.
The <strong>EventContent</strong> will in this case be ignored,
so why not set it to <strong>undefined</strong>.
</p><a name="Time-Out Zero"></a><h2>Time-Out Zero</h2><p>
If a time-out is started with the time <strong>0</strong> it will
actually not be started.  Instead the time-out event will
immediately be inserted to be processed after any events
already enqueued, and before any not yet received external events.
Note that some time-outs are automatically cancelled
so if you for example combine
<a href="#Postponing Events">postponing</a>
an event in a <em>state change</em> with starting an
<a href="#Event Time-Outs">event time-out</a>
with time <strong>0</strong> there will be no timeout event inserted
since the event time-out is cancelled by the postponed
event that is delivered due to the state change.
</p><a name="Example"></a><h2>Example</h2><p>
A door with a code lock can be seen as a state machine.
Initially, the door is locked. When someone presses a button,
an event is generated.
The pressed buttons are collected, up to the number of buttons
in the correct code.
If correct, the door is unlocked for 10 seconds.
If not correct, we wait for a new button to be pressed.

<strong>start_link</strong> calls function

which spawns and links to a new process, a <strong>gen_statem</strong>.
</p><ul><li> <p>
The first argument, <strong>{local,?NAME}</strong>, specifies
the name. In this case, the <strong>gen_statem</strong> is locally
registered as <strong>code_lock</strong> through the macro <strong>?NAME</strong>.
</p> <p>
If the name is omitted, the <strong>gen_statem</strong> is not registered.
Instead its pid must be used. The name can also be specified
as <strong>{global,Name}</strong>, then the <strong>gen_statem</strong> is
registered using
<a href="../kernel/global#register_name/2">kernel/global#register_name/2</a>
in Kernel.
</p> </li><li> <p>
The second argument, <strong>?MODULE</strong>, is the name of
the <em>callback module</em>, that is,
the module where the callback
functions are located, which is this module.
</p> <p>
The interface functions (<strong>start_link/1</strong> and <strong>button/1</strong>)
are located in the same module as the callback functions
(<strong>init/1</strong>, <strong>locked/3</strong>, and <strong>open/3</strong>).
It is normally good programming practice to have the client-side
code and the server-side code contained in one module.
</p> </li><li> <p>
The third argument, <strong>Code</strong>, is a list of digits, which
is the correct unlock code that is passed
to callback function <strong>init/1</strong>.
</p> </li><li> <p>
The fourth argument, <strong>[]</strong>, is a list of options.
For the available options, see

</p><pre><code class="erl">

    gen_statem:cast(?NAME, {button,Button}).

The first argument is the name of the <strong>gen_statem</strong> and must
agree with the name used to start it. So, we use the
same macro <strong>?NAME</strong> as when starting.
<strong>{button,Button}</strong> is the event content.
</p><p>
The event is sent to the <strong>gen_statem</strong>.
When the event is received, the <strong>gen_statem</strong> calls
<strong>StateName(cast, Event, Data)</strong>, which is expected to
return a tuple <strong>{next_state, NewStateName, NewData}</strong>,
or <strong>{next_state, NewStateName, NewData, Actions}</strong>.
<strong>StateName</strong> is the name of the current state and
<strong>NewStateName</strong> is the name of the next state to go to.
<strong>NewData</strong> is a new value for the server data of
the <strong>gen_statem</strong>, and <strong>Actions</strong> is a list of
actions to be performed by the <strong>gen_statem</strong> engine.
</p><pre><code class="erl">

    end.
    </code></pre><p>
In state <strong>locked</strong>, when a button is pressed,
it is collected with the last pressed buttons
up to the length of the correct code,
and compared with the correct code.
Depending on the result, the door is either unlocked
and the <strong>gen_statem</strong> goes to state <strong>open</strong>,
or the door remains in state <strong>locked</strong>.
</p><p>
When changing to state <strong>open</strong>, the collected
buttons are reset, the lock unlocked, and a state timer
for 10 s is started.
</p><pre><code class="erl">
open(cast, {button,_}, Data) -&gt;
    {next_state, open, Data}.
    </code></pre><p>
In state <strong>open</strong>, a button event is ignored
by staying in the same state.  This can also be done
by returning <strong>{keep_state, Data}</strong> or in this case
since <strong>Data</strong> unchanged even by returning
<strong>keep_state_and_data</strong>.
</p><a name="State Time-Outs"></a><h2>State Time-Outs</h2><p>
When a correct code has been given, the door is unlocked and
the following tuple is returned from <strong>locked/2</strong>:
</p><pre><code class="erl">
{next_state, open, Data#{buttons := []},
 [{state_timeout,10000,lock}]}; % Time in milliseconds
 </code></pre><p>
10,000 is a time-out value in milliseconds.
After this time (10 seconds), a time-out occurs.
Then, <strong>StateName(state_timeout, lock, Data)</strong> is called.
The time-out occurs when the door has been in state <strong>open</strong>
for 10 seconds. After that the door is locked again:
</p><pre><code class="erl">
open(state_timeout, lock,  Data) -&gt;
    do_lock(),
    {next_state, locked, Data};
    </code></pre><p>
The timer for a state time-out is automatically cancelled
when the state machine does a <em>state change</em>.
You can restart a state time-out by setting it to a new time,
which cancels the running timer and starts a new.
This implies that you can cancel a state time-out
by restarting it with time <strong>infinity</strong>.
</p><a name="All State Events"></a><h2>All State Events</h2><p>
Sometimes events can arrive in any state of the <strong>gen_statem</strong>.
It is convenient to handle these in a common state handler function
that all state functions call for events not specific to the state.
</p><p>
Consider a <strong>code_length/0</strong> function that returns
the length of the correct code.
We dispatch all events that are not state-specific
to the common function <strong>handle_common/3</strong>:
</p><pre><code class="erl">
...
-export([button/1,code_length/0]).
...

code_length() -&gt;
    gen_statem:call(?NAME, code_length).

...
locked(...) -&gt; ... ;
locked(EventType, EventContent, Data) -&gt;
    handle_common(EventType, EventContent, Data).

...
open(...) -&gt; ... ;
open(EventType, EventContent, Data) -&gt;
    handle_common(EventType, EventContent, Data).

handle_common({call,From}, code_length, #{code := Code} = Data) -&gt;
    {keep_state, Data,
     [{reply,From,length(Code)}]}.
    </code></pre><p>
Another way to do it is through a convenience macro
<strong>?HANDLE_COMMON/0</strong>:
</p><pre><code class="erl">
...
-export([button/1,code_length/0]).
...

code_length() -&gt;
    gen_statem:call(?NAME, code_length).

-define(HANDLE_COMMON,
    ?FUNCTION_NAME(T, C, D) -&gt; handle_common(T, C, D)).
%%
handle_common({call,From}, code_length, #{code := Code} = Data) -&gt;
    {keep_state, Data,
     [{reply,From,length(Code)}]}.

...
locked(...) -&gt; ... ;
?HANDLE_COMMON.

...
open(...) -&gt; ... ;
?HANDLE_COMMON.
</code></pre><p>
This example uses
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#call/2">stdlib/gen_statem#call/2</a>,
which waits for a reply from the server.
The reply is sent with a <strong>{reply,From,Reply}</strong> tuple
in an action list in the <strong>{keep_state, ...}</strong> tuple
that retains the current state.  This return form is convenient
when you want to stay in the current state but do not know or
care about what it is.
</p><p>
If the common <em>state callback</em> needs to know the current state
a function <strong>handle_common/4</strong> can be used instead:
</p><pre><code class="erl">
-define(HANDLE_COMMON,
    ?FUNCTION_NAME(T, C, D) -&gt; handle_common(T, C, ?FUNCTION_NAME, D)).
    </code></pre><a name="One State Callback"></a><h2>One State Callback</h2><p>

all events are handled in

where we first branch depending on event

</code></pre><a name="Stopping"></a><h2>Stopping</h2><a name="In a Supervision Tree"></a><h2>In a Supervision Tree</h2><p>
If the <strong>gen_statem</strong> is part of a supervision tree,
no stop function is needed.
The <strong>gen_statem</strong> is automatically terminated by its supervisor.
Exactly how this is done is defined by a
<a href="./sup_princ#shutdown">shutdown strategy</a>
set in the supervisor.
</p><p>
If it is necessary to clean up before termination, the shutdown
strategy must be a time-out value and the <strong>gen_statem</strong> must
in function <strong>init/1</strong> set itself to trap exit signals
by calling
<a href="../erts/erlang#process_flag/2">erts/erlang#process_flag/2</a>:
</p><pre><code class="erl">
init(Args) -&gt;
    process_flag(trap_exit, true),
    do_lock(),
    ...
    </code></pre><p>
When ordered to shut down, the <strong>gen_statem</strong> then calls
callback function <strong>terminate(shutdown, State, Data)</strong>.
</p><p>
In this example, function <strong>terminate/3</strong>
locks the door if it is open, so we do not accidentally leave the door
open when the supervision tree terminates:
</p><pre><code class="erl">
terminate(_Reason, State, _Data) -&gt;
    State =/= locked andalso do_lock(),
    ok.
    </code></pre><a name="Standalone gen_statem"></a><h2>Standalone gen_statem</h2><p>
If the <strong>gen_statem</strong> is not part of a supervision tree,
it can be stopped using
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#stop/1">stdlib/gen_statem#stop/1</a>,
preferably through an API function:
</p><pre><code class="erl">
...
-export([start_link/1,stop/0]).

...
stop() -&gt;
    gen_statem:stop(?NAME).
    </code></pre><p>
This makes the <strong>gen_statem</strong> call callback function
<strong>terminate/3</strong> just like for a supervised server
and waits for the process to terminate.
</p><a name="Event Time-Outs"></a><h2>Event Time-Outs</h2><p>
A time-out feature inherited from <strong>gen_statem</strong>'s predecessor
<a href="./gen_fsm">stdlib/gen_fsm</a>,
is an event time-out, that is,
if an event arrives the timer is cancelled.
You get either an event or a time-out, but not both.
</p><p>
It is ordered by the
<a href="#Transition Actions">Transition Actions</a>
<strong>{timeout,Time,EventContent}</strong>, or just an integer <strong>Time</strong>,
even without the enclosing actions list
(the latter is a form inherited from <strong>gen_fsm</strong>.
</p><p>
This type of time-out is useful for example to act on inactivity.
Let us restart the code sequence
if no button is pressed for say 30 seconds:
</p><pre><code class="erl">
...

locked(timeout, _, Data) -&gt;
    {next_state, locked, Data#{buttons := []}};
locked(
  cast, {button,Button},
  #{code := Code, length := Length, buttons := Buttons} = Data) -&gt;
...
	true -&gt; % Incomplete | Incorrect
            {next_state, locked, Data#{buttons := NewButtons},
             30000} % Time in milliseconds
...
</code></pre><p>
Whenever we receive a button event we start an event time-out
of 30 seconds, and if we get an <em>event type</em> of <strong>timeout</strong>
we reset the remaining code sequence.
</p><p>
An event time-out is cancelled by any other event so you either
get some other event or the time-out event.  It is therefore
not possible nor needed to cancel or restart an event time-out.
Whatever event you act on has already cancelled
the event time-out...
</p><p>
Note that an event time-out does not work well with
when you have for example a status call as in section
<a href="#All State Events">All State Events</a>,
or handle unknown events, since all kinds of events
will cancel the event time-out.
</p><a name="Generic Time-Outs"></a><h2>Generic Time-Outs</h2><p>
The previous example of state time-outs only work if
the state machine stays in the same state during the
time-out time.  And event time-outs only work if no
disturbing unrelated events occur.
</p><p>
You may want to start a timer in one state and respond
to the time-out in another, maybe cancel the time-out
without changing states, or perhaps run multiple
time-outs in parallel. All this can be accomplished with
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-generic_timeout">generic time-outs</a>.
They may look a little bit like
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-event_timeout">event time-outs</a>
but contain a name to allow for any number of them simultaneously
and they are not automatically cancelled.
</p><p>
Here is how to accomplish the state time-out
in the previous example by instead using a generic time-out
named for example <strong>open</strong>:
</p><pre><code class="erl">
...
locked(
  cast, {button,Button},
  #{code := Code, length := Length, buttons := Buttons} = Data) -&gt;
...
    if
        NewButtons =:= Code -&gt; % Correct
	    do_unlock(),
            {next_state, open, Data#{buttons := []},
             [{{timeout,open},10000,lock}]}; % Time in milliseconds
...

open({timeout,open}, lock, Data) -&gt;
    do_lock(),
    {next_state,locked,Data};
open(cast, {button,_}, Data) -&gt;
    {keep_state,Data};
...
</code></pre><p>
Specific generic time-outs can just as
<a href="#State Time-Outs">state time-outs</a>
be restarted or cancelled
by setting it to a new time or <strong>infinity</strong>.
</p><p>
In this particular case we do not need to cancel the time-out
since the time-out event is the only possible reason to
do a <em>state change</em> from <strong>open</strong> to <strong>locked</strong>.
</p><p>
Instead of bothering with when to cancel a time-out,
a late time-out event can be handled by ignoring it
if it arrives in a state where it is known to be late.
</p><a name="Erlang Timers"></a><h2>Erlang Timers</h2><p>
The most versatile way to handle time-outs is to use
Erlang Timers; see
<a href="../erts/erlang#start_timer/4">erts/erlang#start_timer/4</a>.
Most time-out tasks can be performed with the
time-out features in <strong>gen_statem</strong>,
but an example of one that cannot is if you should need
the return value from
<a href="../erts/erlang#cancel_timer/2">erts/erlang#cancel_timer/2</a>, that is; the remaining time of the timer.
</p><p>
Here is how to accomplish the state time-out
in the previous example by instead using an Erlang Timer:
</p><pre><code class="erl">
...
locked(
  cast, {button,Button},
  #{code := Code, length := Length, buttons := Buttons} = Data) -&gt;
...
    if
        NewButtons =:= Code -&gt; % Correct
	    do_unlock(),
	    Tref =
                 erlang:start_timer(
                     10000, self(), lock), % Time in milliseconds
            {next_state, open, Data#{buttons := [], timer =&gt; Tref}};
...

open(info, {timeout,Tref,lock}, #{timer := Tref} = Data) -&gt;
    do_lock(),
    {next_state,locked,maps:remove(timer, Data)};
open(cast, {button,_}, Data) -&gt;
    {keep_state,Data};
...
</code></pre><p>
Removing the <strong>timer</strong> key from the map when we
do a <em>state change</em> to <strong>locked</strong> is not strictly
necessary since we can only get into state <strong>open</strong>
with an updated <strong>timer</strong> map value.  But it can be nice
to not have outdated values in the state <strong>Data</strong>!
</p><p>
If you need to cancel a timer because of some other event, you can use
<a href="../erts/erlang#cancel_timer/2">erts/erlang#cancel_timer/2</a>.
Note that a time-out message cannot arrive after this,
unless you have postponed it before (see the next section),
so ensure that you do not accidentally postpone such messages.
Also note that a time-out message may have arrived
just before you cancelling it, so you may have to read out
such a message from the process mailbox depending on
the return value from 
<a href="../erts/erlang#cancel_timer/2">erts/erlang#cancel_timer/2</a>.
</p><p>
Another way to handle a late time-out can be to not cancel it,
but to ignore it if it arrives in a state
where it is known to be late.
</p><a name="Postponing Events"></a><h2>Postponing Events</h2><p>
If you want to ignore a particular event in the current state
and handle it in a future state, you can postpone the event.
A postponed event is retried after a <em>state change</em>,
that is, <strong>OldState =/= NewState</strong>.
</p><p>
Postponing is ordered by the
<a href="#Transition Actions">Transition Actions</a>
<strong>postpone</strong>.
</p><p>
In this example, instead of ignoring button events
while in the <strong>open</strong> state, we can postpone them
and they are queued and later handled in the <strong>locked</strong> state:
</p><pre><code class="erl">
...
open(cast, {button,_}, Data) -&gt;
    {keep_state,Data,[postpone]};
...
</code></pre><p>
Since a postponed event is only retried
after a <em>state change</em>,
you have to think about where to keep a state data item.
You can keep it in the server <strong>Data</strong>
or in the <strong>State</strong> itself,
for example by having two more or less identical states
to keep a boolean value, or by using a complex state
(see section
<a href="#Complex State">Complex State</a>)
with
<a href="#Callback Modes">Callback Modes</a>
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-callback_mode">stdlib/gen_statem#type-callback_mode</a>.
If a change in the value changes the set of events that is handled,
then the value should be kept in the State.
Otherwise no postponed events will be retried
since only the server Data changes.
</p><p>
This is not important if you do not postpone events.
But if you later decide to start postponing some events,
then the design flaw of not having separate states
when they should be, might become a hard to find bug.
</p><a name="Fuzzy State Diagrams"></a><h2>Fuzzy State Diagrams</h2><p>
It is not uncommon that a state diagram does not specify
how to handle events that are not illustrated
in a particular state in the diagram.
Hopefully this is described in an associated text
or from the context.
</p><p>
Possible actions: ignore as in drop the event
(maybe log it) or deal with the event in some other state
as in postpone it.
</p><a name="Selective Receive"></a><h2>Selective Receive</h2><p>
Erlang's selective receive statement is often used to
describe simple state machine examples in straightforward
Erlang code. The following is a possible implementation of
the first example:
</p><pre><code class="erl">
-module(code_lock).
-define(NAME, code_lock_1).
-export([start_link/1,button/1]).

start_link(Code) -&gt;
    spawn(
      fun () -&gt;
	      true = register(?NAME, self()),
	      do_lock(),
	      locked(Code, length(Code), [])
      end).

button(Button) -&gt;
    ?NAME ! {button,Button}.
    </code></pre><pre><code class="erl">

                    length(Buttons) &lt; Length -&gt;
                        Buttons;
                    true -&gt;
                        tl(Buttons)
                end ++ [Button],
            if
                NewButtons =:= Code -&gt; % Correct
                    do_unlock(),
		    open(Code, Length);
                true -&gt; % Incomplete | Incorrect
                    locked(Code, Length, NewButtons)

    end.

do_lock() -&gt;
    io:format("Locked~n", []).
do_unlock() -&gt;
    io:format("Open~n", []).
    </code></pre><p>
The selective receive in this case causes implicitly <strong>open</strong>
to postpone any events to the <strong>locked</strong> state.
</p><p>
A selective receive cannot be used from a <strong>gen_statem</strong>
behavior as for any <strong>gen_*</strong> behavior,
as the receive statement is within the <strong>gen_*</strong> engine itself.
It must be there because all
<a href="./sys">stdlib/sys</a>
compatible behaviors must respond to system messages and therefore
do that in their engine receive loop,
passing non-system messages to the <em>callback module</em>.
</p><p>
The
<a href="#Transition Actions">Transition Actions</a>
<strong>postpone</strong> is designed to model
selective receives. A selective receive implicitly postpones
any not received events, but the <strong>postpone</strong>
<em>transition action</em> explicitly postpones one received event.
</p><p>
Both mechanisms have the same theoretical
time and memory complexity, while the selective receive
language construct has smaller constant factors.
</p><a name="State Enter Actions"></a><h2>State Enter Actions</h2><p>
Say you have a state machine specification
that uses state enter actions.
Allthough you can code this using inserted events
(described in the next section), especially if just
one or a few states has got state enter actions,
this is a perfect use case for the built in
<a href="#State Enter Calls">State Enter Calls</a>.
</p><p>
You return a list containing <strong>state_enter</strong> from your
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#Module:callback_mode/0">stdlib/gen_statem#Module:callback_mode/0</a>
function and the <strong>gen_statem</strong> engine will call your
<em>state callback</em> once with an event
<strong>(enter, OldState, ...)</strong>
whenever it does a <em>state change</em>.
Then you just need to handle these event-like calls in all states.
</p><pre><code class="erl">
...
init(Code) -&gt;
    process_flag(trap_exit, true),
    Data = #{code =&gt; Code, length = length(Code)},
    {ok, locked, Data}.

callback_mode() -&gt;
    [state_functions,state_enter].

locked(enter, _OldState, Data) -&gt;
    do_lock(),
    {keep_state,Data#{buttons =&gt; []}};
locked(
  cast, {button,Button},
  #{code := Code, length := Length, buttons := Buttons} = Data) -&gt;
...
    if
        NewButtons =:= Code -&gt; % Correct
            {next_state, open, Data};
...

open(enter, _OldState, _Data) -&gt;
    do_unlock(),
    {keep_state_and_data,
     [{state_timeout,10000,lock}]}; % Time in milliseconds
open(state_timeout, lock, Data) -&gt;
    {next_state, locked, Data};
...
</code></pre><p>
You can repeat the state enter code by returning one of
<strong>{repeat_state, ...}</strong>, <strong>{repeat_state_and_data,_}</strong>
or <strong>repeat_state_and_data</strong> that otherwise behaves
exactly like their <strong>keep_state</strong> siblings.
See the type
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-state_callback_result">stdlib/gen_statem#type-state_callback_result</a>
in the reference manual.
</p><a name="Inserted Events"></a><h2>Inserted Events</h2><p>
It can sometimes be beneficial to be able to generate events
to your own state machine.
This can be done with the
<a href="#Transition Actions">Transition Actions</a>
<strong>{next_event,EventType,EventContent}</strong>.
</p><p>
You can generate events of any existing
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-action">type</a>,
but the <strong>internal</strong> type can only be generated through action
<strong>next_event</strong>. Hence, it cannot come from an external source,
so you can be certain that an <strong>internal</strong> event is an event
from your state machine to itself.
</p><p>
One example for this is to pre-process incoming data, for example
decrypting chunks or collecting characters up to a line break.
</p><p>
Purists may argue that this should be modelled with a separate
state machine that sends pre-processed events
to the main state machine,
but to decrease overhead the small pre-processing state machine
can be implemented in the common state event handling
of the main state machine using a few state data variables
that then sends the pre-processed events as internal events
to the main state machine.
Using internal events also can make it easier
to synchronize the state machines.
</p><p>
A variant of this is to use a
<a href="#Complex State">complex state</a>
with
<a href="#One State Callback">One State Callback</a>.
The state is then modeled with for example a tuple
<strong>{MainFSMState,SubFSMState}</strong>.
</p><p>
To illustrate this we make up an example where the buttons
instead generate down and up (press and release) events,
and the lock responds to an up event only after
the corresponding down event.
</p><pre><code class="erl">

This section includes the example after most of the mentioned

which deserves a new state diagram:
</p><img src="../design_principles/code_lock_2.svg" title="Code Lock State Diagram Revisited"></img><p>
Notice that this state diagram does not specify how to handle
a button event in the state <strong>open</strong>. So, you need to
read in some side notes, that is, here: that unspecified events
shall be postponed (handled in some later state).
Also, the state diagram does not show that the <strong>code_length/0</strong>

Notice that postponing buttons from the <strong>open</strong> state
to the <strong>locked</strong> state feels like a strange thing to do
for a code lock, but it at least illustrates event postponing.
</p><a name="Filter the State"></a><h2>Filter the State</h2><p>
The example servers so far in this chapter
print the full internal state in the error log, for example,
when killed by an exit signal or because of an internal error.
This state contains both the code lock code
and which digits that remain to unlock.
</p><p>
This state data can be regarded as sensitive,
and maybe not what you want in the error log
because of some unpredictable event.
</p><p>
Another reason to filter the state can be
that the state is too large to print, as it fills
the error log with uninteresting details.
</p><p>
To avoid this, you can format the internal state
that gets in the error log and gets returned from
<a href="../stdlib/sys#get_status/1">stdlib/sys#get_status/1</a>
by implementing function
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#Module:format_status/2">stdlib/gen_statem#Module:format_status/2</a>,
for example like this:
</p><pre><code class="erl">
...
-export([init/1,terminate/3,format_status/2]).
...

format_status(Opt, [_PDict,State,Data]) -&gt;
    StateData =
	{State,
	 maps:filter(
	   fun (code, _) -&gt; false;
	       (_, _) -&gt; true
	   end,
	   Data)},
    case Opt of
	terminate -&gt;
	    StateData;
	normal -&gt;
	    [{data,[{"State",StateData}]}]
    end.
    </code></pre><p>
It is not mandatory to implement a
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#Module:format_status/2">stdlib/gen_statem#Module:format_status/2</a>
function. If you do not, a default implementation is used that
does the same as this example function without filtering
the <strong>Data</strong> term, that is, <strong>StateData = {State,Data}</strong>,
in this example containing sensitive information.
</p><a name="Complex State"></a><h2>Complex State</h2><p>
The <em>callback mode</em>
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-callback_mode">stdlib/gen_statem#type-callback_mode</a>
enables using a non-atom state as described in section
<a href="#Callback Modes">Callback Modes</a>,
for example, a complex state term like a tuple.
</p><p>
One reason to use this is when you have a state item
that when changed should cancel the
<a href="#State Time-Outs">state time-out</a>,
or one that affects the event handling
in combination with postponing events.
We will go for the latter and complicate the previous example
by introducing a configurable lock button
(this is the state item in question),
which in the <strong>open</strong> state immediately locks the door,
and an API function <strong>set_lock_button/1</strong> to set the lock button.
</p><p>
Suppose now that we call <strong>set_lock_button</strong>
while the door is open,
and we have already postponed a button event
that was the new lock button:
</p><pre><code class="erl">
1&gt; code_lock:start_link([a,b,c], x).
{ok,&lt;0.666.0&gt;}
2&gt; code_lock:button(a).
ok
3&gt; code_lock:button(b).
ok
4&gt; code_lock:button(c).
ok
Open
5&gt; code_lock:button(y).
ok
6&gt; code_lock:set_lock_button(y).
x
% What should happen here?  Immediate lock or nothing?
</code></pre><p>
We could say that the button was pressed too early
so it is not to be recognized as the lock button.
Or we can make the lock button part of the state so
when we then change the lock button in the locked state,
the change becomes a <em>state change</em>
and all postponed events are retried,
therefore the lock is immediately locked!
</p><p>
We define the state as <strong>{StateName,LockButton}</strong>,
where <strong>StateName</strong> is as before
and <strong>LockButton</strong> is the current lock button:

If you have many servers in one node
and they have some state(s) in their lifetime in which
the servers can be expected to idle for a while,
and the amount of heap memory all these servers need
is a problem, then the memory footprint of a server
can be mimimized by hibernating it through
<a href="../stdlib/proc_lib#hibernate/3">stdlib/proc_lib#hibernate/3</a>.
</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>
It is rather costly to hibernate a process; see
<a href="../erts/erlang#hibernate/3">erts/erlang#hibernate/3</a>.
It is not something you want to do after every event.
</p></div><p>
We can in this example hibernate in the <strong>{open,_}</strong> state,
because what normally occurs in that state is that
the state time-out after a while
triggers a transition to <strong>{locked,_}</strong>:
</p><pre><code class="erl">
...
%%
%% State: open
handle_event(enter, _OldState, {open,_}, _Data) -&gt;
    do_unlock(),
    {keep_state_and_data,
     [{state_timeout,10000,lock}, % Time in milliseconds
      hibernate]};
...
</code></pre><p>
The atom
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-hibernate">stdlib/gen_statem#type-hibernate</a>
in the action list on the last line
when entering the <strong>{open,_}</strong> state is the only change.
If any event arrives in the <strong>{open,_},</strong> state, we
do not bother to rehibernate, so the server stays
awake after any event.
</p><p>
To change that we would need to insert
action <strong>hibernate</strong> in more places.
For example, the state-independent <strong>set_lock_button</strong>
operation would have to use <strong>hibernate</strong> but only in the
<strong>{open,_}</strong> state, which would clutter the code.
</p><p>
Another not uncommon scenario is to use the
<a href="#Event Time-Outs">event time-out</a>
to trigger hibernation after a certain time of inactivity.
There is also a server start option
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#type-enter_loop_opt">stdlib/gen_statem#type-enter_loop_opt</a>
for
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#start/3">stdlib/gen_statem#start/3</a>,
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#start_link/3">stdlib/gen_statem#start_link/3</a>
or
<a href="../stdlib/gen_statem#enter_loop/4">stdlib/gen_statem#enter_loop/4</a>
that may be used to automatically hibernate the server.
</p><p>
This particular server probably does not use
heap memory worth hibernating for.
To gain anything from hibernation, your server would
have to produce non-insignificant garbage
during callback execution,
for which this example server can serve as a bad example.
