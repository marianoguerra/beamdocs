structure Erlang code in terms of processes, modules,
and directories.</p><h2>Supervision Trees</h2><p>A basic concept in Erlang/OTP is the <em>supervision tree</em>.
This is a process structuring model based on the idea of
<em>workers</em> and <em>supervisors</em>:</p><ul><li>Workers are processes that perform computations, that is, they do the actual work.</li><li>Supervisors are processes that monitor the behaviour of workers. A supervisor can restart a worker if something goes wrong.</li><li>The supervision tree is a hierarchical arrangement of code into supervisors and workers, which makes it possible to design and program fault-tolerant software.</li></ul><p>In the following figure, square boxes represents supervisors and
circles represent workers:</p><a name="sup6"></a><img src="../design_principles/sup6.gif" title="Supervision Tree"></img><h2>Behaviours</h2><p>In a supervision tree, many of the processes have similar
structures, they follow similar patterns. For example,
the supervisors are similar in structure. The only difference
between them is which child processes they supervise. Many
of the workers are servers in a server-client relation,
finite-state machines, or event handlers.</p><p><em>Behaviours</em> are formalizations of these common patterns.
The idea is to divide the code for a process in a generic part
(a behaviour module) and a specific part (a
<em>callback module</em>).</p><p>The behaviour module is part of Erlang/OTP. To implement a
process such as a supervisor, the user only has to implement
the callback module which is to export a pre-defined set of
functions, the <em>callback functions</em>.</p><p>The following example illustrate how code can be divided into a
generic and a specific part. Consider the following code (written in
plain Erlang) for a simple server, which keeps track of a number
of "channels". Other processes can allocate and free the channels
by calling the functions <strong>alloc/0</strong> and <strong>free/1</strong>,
respectively.</p><a name="ch1"></a><pre><code class="">
-module(ch1).
-export([start/0]).
-export([alloc/0, free/1]).
-export([init/0]).

start() -&gt;
    spawn(ch1, init, []).

alloc() -&gt;
    ch1 ! {self(), alloc},
    receive
        {ch1, Res} -&gt;
            Res
    end.

free(Ch) -&gt;
    ch1 ! {free, Ch},
    ok.

init() -&gt;
    register(ch1, self()),
    Chs = channels(),
    loop(Chs).

loop(Chs) -&gt;
    receive
        {From, alloc} -&gt;
            {Ch, Chs2} = alloc(Chs),
            From ! {ch1, Ch},
            loop(Chs2);
        {free, Ch} -&gt;
            Chs2 = free(Ch, Chs),
            loop(Chs2)
    end.</code></pre><p>The code for the server can be rewritten into a generic part
<strong>server.erl</strong>:</p><pre><code class="">
-module(server).
-export([start/1]).
-export([call/2, cast/2]).
-export([init/1]).

start(Mod) -&gt;
    spawn(server, init, [Mod]).

call(Name, Req) -&gt;
    Name ! {call, self(), Req},
    receive
        {Name, Res} -&gt;
            Res
    end.

cast(Name, Req) -&gt;
    Name ! {cast, Req},
    ok.

init(Mod) -&gt;
    register(Mod, self()),
    State = Mod:init(),
    loop(Mod, State).

loop(Mod, State) -&gt;
    receive
        {call, From, Req} -&gt;
            {Res, State2} = Mod:handle_call(Req, State),
            From ! {Mod, Res},
            loop(Mod, State2);
        {cast, Req} -&gt;
            State2 = Mod:handle_cast(Req, State),
            loop(Mod, State2)
    end.</code></pre><p>And a callback module <strong>ch2.erl</strong>:</p><pre><code class="">
-module(ch2).
-export([start/0]).
-export([alloc/0, free/1]).
-export([init/0, handle_call/2, handle_cast/2]).

start() -&gt;
    server:start(ch2).

alloc() -&gt;
    server:call(ch2, alloc).

free(Ch) -&gt;
    server:cast(ch2, {free, Ch}).

init() -&gt;
    channels().

handle_call(alloc, Chs) -&gt;
    alloc(Chs). % =&gt; {Ch,Chs2}

handle_cast({free, Ch}, Chs) -&gt;
    free(Ch, Chs). % =&gt; Chs2</code></pre><p>Notice the following:</p><ul><li>The code in <strong>server</strong> can be reused to build many different servers.</li><li>The server name, in this example the atom <strong>ch2</strong>, is hidden from the users of the client functions. This means that the name can be changed without affecting them.</li><li>The protocol (messages sent to and received from the server) is also hidden. This is good programming practice and allows one to change the protocol without changing the code using the interface functions.</li><li>The functionality of <strong>server</strong> can be extended without having to change <strong>ch2</strong> or any other callback module.</li></ul><p>In <strong>ch1.erl</strong> and <strong>ch2.erl</strong> above, the implementation
of <strong>channels/0</strong>, <strong>alloc/1</strong>, and <strong>free/2</strong> has been
intentionally left out, as it is not relevant to the example.
For completeness, one way to write these functions are given
below. This is an example only, a realistic
implementation must be able to handle situations like running out
of channels to allocate, and so on.</p><pre><code class="">
channels() -&gt;
   {_Allocated = [], _Free = lists:seq(1,100)}.

alloc({Allocated, [H|T] = _Free}) -&gt;
   {H, {[H|Allocated], T}}.

free(Ch, {Alloc, Free} = Channels) -&gt;
   case lists:member(Ch, Alloc) of
      true -&gt;
         {lists:delete(Ch, Alloc), [Ch|Free]};
      false -&gt;
         Channels
   end.        </code></pre><p>Code written without using behaviours can be more
efficient, but the increased efficiency is at the expense of
generality. The ability to manage all applications in the system
in a consistent manner is important.</p><p>Using behaviours also makes it easier to read and understand
code written by other programmers. Improvised programming structures,
while possibly more efficient, are always more difficult to
understand.</p><p>The <strong>server</strong> module corresponds, greatly simplified,
to the Erlang/OTP behaviour <strong>gen_server</strong>.</p><p>The standard Erlang/OTP behaviours are:</p><ul><li><p><a href="gen_server_concepts">gen_server</a></p> <p>For implementing the server of a client-server relation</p></li><li><p><a href="statem">gen_statem</a></p> <p>For implementing state machines</p></li><li><p><a href="events">gen_event</a></p> <p>For implementing event handling functionality</p></li><li><p><a href="sup_princ">supervisor</a></p> <p>For implementing a supervisor in a supervision tree</p></li></ul><p>The compiler understands the module attribute
<strong>-behaviour(Behaviour)</strong> and issues warnings about
missing callback functions, for example:</p><pre><code class="">
-module(chs3).
-behaviour(gen_server).
...

3&gt; c(chs3).
./chs3.erl:10: Warning: undefined call-back function handle_call/3
{ok,chs3}</code></pre><h2>Applications</h2><p>Erlang/OTP comes with a number of components, each implementing
some specific functionality. Components are with Erlang/OTP
terminology called <em>applications</em>. Examples of Erlang/OTP
applications are Mnesia, which has everything needed for
programming database services, and Debugger, which is used
to debug Erlang programs. The minimal system based on Erlang/OTP
consists of the following two applications:</p><ul><li>Kernel - Functionality necessary to run Erlang</li><li>STDLIB - Erlang standard libraries</li></ul><p>The application concept applies both to program structure
(processes) and directory structure (modules).</p><p>The simplest applications do not have any processes,
but consist of a collection of functional modules. Such an
application is called a <em>library application</em>. An example
of a library application is STDLIB.</p><p>An application with processes is easiest implemented as a
supervision tree using the standard behaviours.</p><p>How to program applications is described in
<a href="applications">Applications</a>.</p><h2>Releases</h2><p>A <em>release</em> is a complete system made out from a subset of
Erlang/OTP applications and a set of user-specific applications.</p><p>How to program releases is described in
<a href="release_structure">Releases</a>.</p><p>How to install a release in a target environment is described
in the section about target systems in Section 2 System Principles.</p><h2>Release Handling</h2><p><em>Release handling</em> is upgrading and downgrading between
different versions of a release, in a (possibly) running system.
How to do this is described in
<a href="release_handling">Release Handling</a>.</p></body></html>
