This document describes how to build and install Erlang/OTP-22.
Erlang/OTP should be possible to build from source on any Unix/Linux system,
including OS X. You are advised to read the whole document
before attempting to build and install Erlang/OTP.
</p><p>
The source code can be downloaded from the official site of Erlang/OTP or GitHub.

Some applications are automatically skipped if the dependencies aren't met.
Here is a list of utilities needed for those applications. You will
also find the utilities needed for building the documentation.
</p><a name="Optional-Utilities_Building"></a><h2>Building</h2><ul><li> <p>OpenSSL -- The opensource toolkit for Secure Socket Layer
and Transport Layer Security.
Required for building the application <strong>crypto</strong>.
Further, <strong>ssl</strong> and <strong>ssh</strong> require a working crypto application and
will also be skipped if OpenSSL is missing. The <strong>public_key</strong>
application is available without <strong>crypto</strong>, but the functionality
will be very limited.
</p> <p>The development package of OpenSSL including the header files are needed as well

The following instructions are for building <a href="http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_22.0-rc3.tar.gz">the released source tar ball</a>.
</p><p>
The variable <strong>$ERL_TOP</strong> will be mentioned a lot of times. It refers to
the top directory in the source tree. More information about <strong>$ERL_TOP</strong>
can be found in the <a href="#Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_make-and-ERLTOP">make and $ERL_TOP</a> section below. If you are
building in git you probably want to take a look at the <a href="#Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Building_Within-Git">Building in Git</a>
section below before proceeding.
</p><a name="How-to-Build-and-Install-ErlangOTP_Unpacking"></a><h2>Unpacking</h2><p>
Start by unpacking the Erlang/OTP distribution file with your GNU
compatible TAR program.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ tar -zxf otp_src_22.0-rc3.tar.gz    # Assuming bash/sh
</code></pre><p>
Now change directory into the base directory and set the <strong>$ERL_TOP</strong> variable.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ cd otp_src_22.0-rc3
$ export ERL_TOP=`pwd`    # Assuming bash/sh
</code></pre><a name="How-to-Build-and-Install-ErlangOTP_Configuring"></a><h2>Configuring</h2><p>
Run the following commands to configure the build:
</p><pre><code class="">
$ ./configure [ options ]
</code></pre><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>
If you are building Erlang/OTP from git you will need to run <strong>./otp_build autoconf</strong> to generate
the configure scripts.
</p></div><p>
By default, Erlang/OTP release will be installed in <strong>/usr/local/{bin,lib/erlang}</strong>.
If you for instance don't have the permission to install in the standard location,
you can install Erlang/OTP somewhere else. For example, to install in
<strong>/opt/erlang/22.0-rc3/{bin,lib/erlang}</strong>, use the <strong>--prefix=/opt/erlang/22.0-rc3</strong> option.
</p><p>
On some platforms Perl may behave strangely if certain locales are
set. If you get errors when building, try setting the LANG variable:
</p><pre><code class="">
$ export LANG=C   # Assuming bash/sh
</code></pre><a name="How-to-Build-and-Install-ErlangOTP_Building"></a><h2>Building</h2><p>
Build the Erlang/OTP release.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ make
</code></pre><a name="How-to-Build-and-Install-ErlangOTP_Testing"></a><h2>Testing</h2><p>
Before installation you should test whether your build is working properly
by running our smoke test. The smoke test is a subset of the complete Erlang/OTP test suites.
First you will need to build and release the test suites.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ make release_tests
</code></pre><p>
This creates an additional folder in <strong>$ERL_TOP/release</strong> called <strong>tests</strong>.
Now, it's time to start the smoke test.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ cd release/tests/test_server
$ $ERL_TOP/bin/erl -s ts install -s ts smoke_test batch -s init stop
</code></pre><p>
To verify that everything is ok you should open <strong>$ERL_TOP/release/tests/test_server/index.html</strong>
in your web browser and make sure that there are zero failed test cases.
</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>
On builds without <strong>crypto</strong>, <strong>ssl</strong> and <strong>ssh</strong> there is a failed test case
for undefined functions. Verify that the failed test case log only shows calls
to skipped applications.
</p></div><a name="How-to-Build-and-Install-ErlangOTP_Installing"></a><h2>Installing</h2><p>
You are now ready to install the Erlang/OTP release!
The following command will install the release on your system.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ make install
</code></pre><a name="How-to-Build-and-Install-ErlangOTP_Running"></a><h2>Running</h2><p>
You should now have a working release of Erlang/OTP!
Jump to <a href="../system_principles/system_principles">System Principles</a> for instructions on running Erlang/OTP.
</p><a name="How-to-Build-and-Install-ErlangOTP_How-to-Build-the-Documentation"></a><h2>How to Build the Documentation</h2><p>
Make sure you're in the top directory in the source tree.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ cd $ERL_TOP
</code></pre><p>
If you have just built Erlang/OTP in the current source tree, you have
already ran <strong>configure</strong> and do not need to do this again; otherwise, run
<strong>configure</strong>.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ ./configure [Configure Args]
</code></pre><p>
When building the documentation you need a full Erlang/OTP-22.0-rc3 system in
the <strong>$PATH</strong>.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ export PATH=$ERL_TOP/bin:$PATH     # Assuming bash/sh
</code></pre><p>
For the FOP print formatter, two steps must be taken:
</p><ul><li> <p>Adding the location of your installation of <strong>fop</strong> in <strong>$FOP_HOME</strong>.
</p> <pre><code class="">
$ export FOP_HOME=/path/to/fop/dir # Assuming bash/sh
</code></pre> </li><li> <p>Adding the <strong>fop</strong> script (in <strong>$FOP_HOME</strong>) to your <strong>$PATH</strong>, either by adding <strong>$FOP_HOME</strong> to <strong>$PATH</strong>, or by copying the <strong>fop</strong> script to a directory already in your <strong>$PATH</strong>.
</p> </li></ul><p>
Build the documentation.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ make docs
</code></pre><a name="How-to-Build-and-Install-ErlangOTP_How-to-Build-the-Documentation_Build-Issues"></a><h2>Build Issues</h2><p>
We have sometimes experienced problems with Oracle's <strong>java</strong> running out of
memory when running <strong>fop</strong>. Increasing the amount of memory available
as follows has in our case solved the problem.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ export FOP_OPTS="-Xmx&lt;Installed amount of RAM in MB&gt;m"
</code></pre><p>

The documentation can be installed either using the <strong>install-docs</strong> target,
or using the <strong>release_docs</strong> target.
</p><ul><li> <p>If you have installed Erlang/OTP using the <strong>install</strong> target, install
the documentation using the <strong>install-docs</strong> target. Install locations
determined by <strong>configure</strong> will be used. <strong>$DESTDIR</strong> can be used the
same way as when doing <strong>make install</strong>.
</p> <pre><code class="">
$ make install-docs
</code></pre> </li><li> <p>If you have installed Erlang/OTP using the <strong>release</strong> target, install
the documentation using the <strong>release_docs</strong> target. You typically want
to use the same <strong>RELEASE_ROOT</strong> as when invoking <strong>make release</strong>.
</p> <pre><code class="">
$ make release_docs RELEASE_ROOT=&lt;release dir&gt;
</code></pre> </li></ul><a name="How-to-Build-and-Install-ErlangOTP_Accessing-the-Documentation"></a><h2>Accessing the Documentation</h2><p>
After installation you can access the documentation by
</p><ul><li> <p>Reading man pages. Make sure that <strong>erl</strong> is referring to the
installed version. For example <strong>/usr/local/bin/erl</strong>.
Try viewing at the man page for Mnesia
</p> <pre><code class="">
$ erl -man mnesia
</code></pre> </li><li> <p>Browsing the html pages by loading the page <strong>/usr/local/lib/erlang/doc/erlang/index.html</strong>
or <strong>&lt;BaseDir&gt;/lib/erlang/doc/erlang/index.html</strong> if the prefix option has been used.
</p> </li></ul><a name="How-to-Build-and-Install-ErlangOTP_How-to-Install-the-Preformatted-Documentation"></a><h2>How to Install the Pre-formatted Documentation</h2><p>
Pre-formatted <a href="http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_doc_html_22.0-rc3.tar.gz">html documentation</a> and <a href="http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_doc_man_22.0-rc3.tar.gz">man pages</a> can be downloaded from
</p><ul><li> <a href="http://www.erlang.org/download.html">http://www.erlang.org/download.html</a>. </li></ul><p>
Extract the html archive in the installation directory.
</p><pre><code class="">

$ tar -zxf otp_html_22.0-rc3.tar.gz
</code></pre><p>
For <strong>erl -man &lt;page&gt;</strong> to work the Unix manual pages have to be
installed in the same way, i.e.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ cd &lt;ReleaseDir&gt;
$ tar -zxf otp_man_22.0-rc3.tar.gz
</code></pre><p>

If you want to tailor your Erlang/OTP build and installation, please read
on for detailed information about the individual steps.
</p><a name="Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_make-and-ERLTOP"></a><h2>make and $ERL_TOP</h2><p>
All the makefiles in the entire directory tree use the environment
variable <strong>ERL_TOP</strong> to find the absolute path of the installation. The
<strong>configure</strong> script will figure this out and set it in the top level
Makefile (which, when building, it will pass on). However, when
developing it is sometimes convenient to be able to run make in a
subdirectory. To do this you must set the <strong>ERL_TOP</strong> variable
before you run make.
</p><p>
For example, assume your GNU make program is called <strong>make</strong> and you
want to rebuild the application <strong>STDLIB</strong>, then you could do:
</p><pre><code class="">
$ cd lib/stdlib; env ERL_TOP=&lt;Dir&gt; make
</code></pre><p>
where <strong>&lt;Dir&gt;</strong> would be what you find <strong>ERL_TOP</strong> is set to in the top level
Makefile.
</p><a name="Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_otpbuild-vs-configuremake"></a><h2>otp_build vs configure/make</h2><p>
Building Erlang/OTP can be done either by using the <strong>$ERL_TOP/otp_build</strong>
script, or by invoking <strong>$ERL_TOP/configure</strong> and <strong>make</strong> directly. Building using
<strong>otp_build</strong> is easier since it involves fewer steps, but the <strong>otp_build</strong> build
procedure is not as flexible as the <strong>configure</strong>/<strong>make</strong> build procedure. The binary
releases for Windows that we deliver are built using <strong>otp_build</strong>.
</p><a name="Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Configuring"></a><h2>Configuring</h2><p>
The configure script is created by the GNU autoconf utility, which
checks for system specific features and then creates a number of makefiles.
</p><p>
The configure script allows you to customize a number of parameters;
type <strong>./configure --help</strong> or <strong>./configure --help=recursive</strong> for details.
<strong>./configure --help=recursive</strong> will give help for all <strong>configure</strong> scripts in
all applications.
</p><p>
One of the things you can specify is where Erlang/OTP should be installed. By
default Erlang/OTP will be installed in <strong>/usr/local/{bin,lib/erlang}</strong>.
To keep the same structure but install in a different place, <strong>&lt;Dir&gt;</strong> say,
use the <strong>--prefix</strong> argument like this: <strong>./configure --prefix=&lt;Dir&gt;</strong>.
</p><p>
Some of the available <strong>configure</strong> options are:
</p><ul><li> <strong>--prefix=PATH</strong> - Specify installation prefix. </li><li> <strong>--disable-parallel-configure</strong> - Disable parallel execution of <strong>configure</strong> scripts (parallel execution is enabled by default) </li><li> <strong>--{enable,disable}-kernel-poll</strong> - Kernel poll support (enabled by default if possible) </li><li> <strong>--{enable,disable}-hipe</strong> - HiPE support (enabled by default on supported platforms) </li><li> <strong>--{enable,disable}-fp-exceptions</strong> - Floating point exceptions (an optimization for floating point operations). The default differs depending on operating system and hardware platform. Note that by enabling this you might get a seemingly working system that sometimes fail on floating point operations. </li><li> <strong>--enable-m64-build</strong> - Build 64-bit binaries using the <strong>-m64</strong> flag to <strong>(g)cc</strong> </li><li> <strong>--enable-m32-build</strong> - Build 32-bit binaries using the <strong>-m32</strong> flag to <strong>(g)cc</strong> </li><li> <strong>--with-assumed-cache-line-size=SIZE</strong> - Set assumed cache-line size in bytes. Default is 64. Valid values are powers of two between and including 16 and 8192. The runtime system use this value in order to try to avoid false sharing. A too large value wastes memory. A to small value will increase the amount of false sharing. </li><li> <strong>--{with,without}-termcap</strong> - termcap (without implies that only the old Erlang shell can be used) </li><li> <strong>--with-javac=JAVAC</strong> - Specify Java compiler to use </li><li> <strong>--{with,without}-javac</strong> - Java compiler (without implies that the <strong>jinterface</strong> application won't be built) </li><li> <strong>--{enable,disable}-dynamic-ssl-lib</strong> - Dynamic OpenSSL libraries </li><li> <strong>--{enable,disable}-builtin-zlib</strong> - Use the built-in source for zlib. </li><li> <strong>--{with,without}-ssl</strong> - OpenSSL (without implies that the <strong>crypto</strong>, <strong>ssh</strong>, and <strong>ssl</strong> won't be built) </li><li> <strong>--with-ssl=PATH</strong> - Specify location of OpenSSL include and lib </li><li> <strong>--with-ssl-incl=PATH</strong> - Location of OpenSSL <strong>include</strong> directory, if different than specified by <strong>--with-ssl=PATH</strong> </li><li> <strong>--with-ssl-rpath=yes|no|PATHS</strong> - Runtime library path for OpenSSL. Default is <strong>yes</strong>, which equates to a number of standard locations. If <strong>no</strong>, then no runtime library paths will be used. Anything else should be a comma separated list of paths. </li><li> <strong>--with-libatomic_ops=PATH</strong> - Use the <strong>libatomic_ops</strong> library for atomic memory accesses. If <strong>configure</strong> should inform you about no native atomic implementation available, you typically want to try using the <strong>libatomic_ops</strong> library. It can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/ivmai/libatomic_ops/">https://github.com/ivmai/libatomic_ops/</a>. </li><li> <strong>--disable-smp-require-native-atomics</strong> - By default <strong>configure</strong> will fail if an SMP runtime system is about to be built, and no implementation for native atomic memory accesses can be found. If this happens, you are encouraged to find a native atomic implementation that can be used, e.g., using <strong>libatomic_ops</strong>, but by passing <strong>--disable-smp-require-native-atomics</strong> you can build using a fallback implementation based on mutexes or spinlocks. Performance of the SMP runtime system will however suffer immensely without an implementation for native atomic memory accesses. </li><li> <strong>--enable-static-{nifs,drivers}</strong> - To allow usage of nifs and drivers on OSs that do not support dynamic linking of libraries it is possible to statically link nifs and drivers with the main Erlang VM binary. This is done by passing a comma separated list to the archives that you want to statically link. e.g. <strong>--enable-static-nifs=/home/$USER/my_nif.a</strong>. The path has to be absolute and the name of the archive has to be the same as the module, i.e. <strong>my_nif</strong> in the example above. This is also true for drivers, but then it is the driver name that has to be the same as the filename. You also have to define <strong>STATIC_ERLANG_{NIF,DRIVER}</strong> when compiling the .o files for the nif/driver. If your nif/driver depends on some other dynamic library, you now have to link that to the Erlang VM binary. This is easily achieved by passing <strong>LIBS=-llibname</strong> to configure. </li><li> <strong>--without-$app</strong> - By default all applications in Erlang/OTP will be included in a release. If this is not wanted it is possible to specify that Erlang/OTP should be compiled without one or more applications, i.e. <strong>--without-wx</strong>. There is no automatic dependency handling between applications. If you disable an application that another application depends on, you also have to disable the dependant application. </li><li> <strong>--enable-gettimeofday-as-os-system-time</strong> - Force usage of <strong>gettimeofday()</strong> for OS system time. </li><li> <strong>--enable-prefer-elapsed-monotonic-time-during-suspend</strong> - Prefer an OS monotonic time source with elapsed time during suspend. </li><li> <strong>--disable-prefer-elapsed-monotonic-time-during-suspend</strong> - Do not prefer an OS monotonic time source with elapsed time during suspend. </li><li> <strong>--with-clock-resolution=high|low</strong> - Try to find clock sources for OS system time, and OS monotonic time with higher or lower resolution than chosen by default. Note that both alternatives may have a negative impact on the performance and scalability compared to the default clock sources chosen. </li><li> <strong>--disable-saved-compile-time</strong> - Disable saving of compile date and time in the emulator binary. </li></ul><p>
If you or your system has special requirements please read the <strong>Makefile</strong> for
additional configuration information.
</p><a name="Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Configuring_Atomic-Memory-Operations-and-the-VM"></a><h2>Atomic Memory Operations and the VM</h2><p>
The VM with SMP support makes quite a heavy use of atomic memory operations.
An implementation providing native atomic memory operations is therefore very
important when building Erlang/OTP. By default the VM will refuse to build
if native atomic memory operations are not available.
</p><p>
Erlang/OTP itself provides implementations of native atomic memory operations
that can be used when compiling with a <strong>gcc</strong> compatible compiler for 32/64-bit
x86, 32/64-bit SPARC V9, 32-bit PowerPC, or 32-bit Tile. When compiling with
a <strong>gcc</strong> compatible compiler for other architectures, the VM may be able to make
use of native atomic operations using the <strong>__atomic_*</strong> builtins (may be
available when using a <strong>gcc</strong> of at least version 4.7) and/or using the
<strong>__sync_*</strong> builtins (may be available when using a <strong>gcc</strong> of at least version
4.1). If only the <strong>gcc</strong>'s <strong>__sync_*</strong> builtins are available, the performance
will suffer. Such a configuration should only be used as a last resort. When
compiling on Windows using a MicroSoft Visual C++ compiler native atomic
memory operations are provided by Windows APIs.
</p><p>
Native atomic implementation in the order preferred:
</p><ul><li> The implementation provided by Erlang/OTP. </li><li> The API provided by Windows. </li><li> The implementation based on the <strong>gcc</strong> <strong>__atomic_*</strong> builtins. </li><li> If none of the above are available for your architecture/compiler, you are recommended to build and install <a href="https://github.com/ivmai/libatomic_ops/">libatomic_ops</a> before building Erlang/OTP. The <strong>libatomic_ops</strong> library provides native atomic memory operations for a variety of architectures and compilers. When building Erlang/OTP you need to inform the build system of where the <strong>libatomic_ops</strong> library is installed using the <strong>--with-libatomic_ops=PATH</strong> <strong>configure</strong> switch. </li><li> As a last resort, the implementation solely based on the <strong>gcc</strong> <strong>__sync_*</strong> builtins. This will however cause lots of expensive and unnecessary memory barrier instructions to be issued. That is, performance will suffer. The <strong>configure</strong> script will warn at the end of its execution if it cannot find any other alternative than this. </li></ul><a name="Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Building"></a><h2>Building</h2><p>
Building Erlang/OTP on a relatively fast computer takes approximately
5 minutes. To speed it up, you can utilize parallel make with the <strong>-j&lt;num_jobs&gt;</strong> option.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ export MAKEFLAGS=-j8    # Assuming bash/sh
$ make
</code></pre><p>
If you've upgraded the source with a patch you may need to clean up from previous
builds before the new build.
Make sure to read the <a href="#Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Building_Prebuilt-Source-Release">Pre-built Source Release</a> section below before doing a <strong>make clean</strong>.
</p><a name="Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Building_Within-Git"></a><h2>Within Git</h2><p>
When building in a Git working directory you also have to have a GNU <strong>autoconf</strong>
of at least version 2.59 on your system, because you need to generate the
<strong>configure</strong> scripts before you can start building.
</p><p>
The <strong>configure</strong> scripts are generated by invoking <strong>./otp_build autoconf</strong> in
the <strong>$ERL_TOP</strong> directory. The <strong>configure</strong> scripts also have to be regenerated
when a <strong>configure.in</strong> or <strong>aclocal.m4</strong> file has been modified. Note that when
checking out a branch a <strong>configure.in</strong> or <strong>aclocal.m4</strong> file may change
content, and you may therefore have to regenerate the <strong>configure</strong> scripts
when checking out a branch. Regenerated <strong>configure</strong> scripts imply that you
have to run <strong>configure</strong> and build again.
</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>
Running <strong>./otp_build autoconf</strong> is <span class="strong">not</span> needed when building
an unmodified version of the released source.

Make sure that the command <strong>hostname</strong> returns a valid fully qualified host
name (this is configured in <strong>/etc/hostconfig</strong>). Otherwise you might experience
problems when running distributed systems.
</p><p>
If you develop linked-in drivers (shared library) you need to link using
<strong>gcc</strong> and the flags <strong>-bundle -flat_namespace -undefined suppress</strong>. You also
include <strong>-fno-common</strong> in <strong>CFLAGS</strong> when compiling. Use <strong>.so</strong> as the library
suffix.

(<strong>wxWidgets-3.0.3.tar.bz2</strong> from <a href="https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/download/v3.0.3/wxWidgets-3.0.3.tar.bz2">https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/download/v3.0.3/wxWidgets-3.0.3.tar.bz2</a>) or get it from github with bug fixes:
</p><pre><code class="">
$ git clone --branch WX_3_0_BRANCH git@github.com:wxWidgets/wxWidgets.git
</code></pre><p>
The wxWidgets-3.1 version should also work if 2.8 compatibility is enabled,
add <strong>--enable-compat28</strong> to configure commands below.
</p><p>
Configure and build wxWidgets (shared library on linux):
</p><pre><code class="">
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
$ make &amp;&amp; sudo make install
$ export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
</code></pre><p>
Configure and build wxWidgets (static library on linux):
</p><pre><code class="">
$ export CFLAGS=-fPIC
$ export CXXFLAGS=-fPIC
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --disable-shared
$ make &amp;&amp; sudo make install
$ export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
</code></pre><p>
Configure and build wxWidgets (on Mavericks - 10.9):
</p><pre><code class="">
$ ./configure --with-cocoa --prefix=/usr/local
or without support for old versions and with static libs
$ ./configure --with-cocoa --prefix=/usr/local --with-macosx-version-min=10.9 --disable-shared
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
</code></pre><p>
Check that you got the correct wx-config
</p><pre><code class="">
$ which wx-config &amp;&amp; wx-config --version-full
</code></pre><p>
Build Erlang/OTP
</p><pre><code class="">
$ export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
$ cd $ERL_TOP
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
</code></pre><a name="Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Building_Prebuilt-Source-Release"></a><h2>Pre-built Source Release</h2><p>
The source release is delivered with a lot of platform independent
build results already pre-built. If you want to remove these pre-built
files, invoke <strong>./otp_build remove_prebuilt_files</strong> from the <strong>$ERL_TOP</strong>
directory. After you have done this, you can build exactly the same way
as before, but the build process will take a much longer time.
</p><div class="alert alert-warning"><h4 class="alert-heading">Warning</h4><p>
Doing <strong>make clean</strong> in an arbitrary directory of the source
tree, may remove files needed for bootstrapping the build.
</p><p>
Doing <strong>./otp_build save_bootstrap</strong> from the <strong>$ERL_TOP</strong> directory before
doing <strong>make clean</strong> will ensure that it will be possible to build after
doing <strong>make clean</strong>. <strong>./otp_build save_bootstrap</strong> will be invoked
automatically when <strong>make</strong> is invoked from <strong>$ERL_TOP</strong> with either the
<strong>clean</strong> target, or the default target. It is also automatically invoked
if <strong>./otp_build remove_prebuilt_files</strong> is invoked.
</p><p>
If you need to verify the bootstrap beam files match the provided
source files, use <strong>./otp_build update_primary</strong> to create a new commit that
contains differences, if any exist.
</p></div><a name="Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Building_How-to-Build-a-Debug-Enabled-Erlang-RunTime-System"></a><h2>How to Build a Debug Enabled Erlang RunTime System</h2><p>
After completing all the normal building steps described above a debug
enabled runtime system can be built. To do this you have to change
directory to <strong>$ERL_TOP/erts/emulator</strong> and execute:
</p><pre><code class="">
$ (cd $ERL_TOP/erts/emulator &amp;&amp; make debug)
</code></pre><p>
This will produce a  beam.smp.debug executable. The
file are installed along side with the normal (opt) version <strong>beam.smp</strong>.
</p><p>
To start the debug enabled runtime system execute:
</p><pre><code class="">
$ $ERL_TOP/bin/cerl -debug
</code></pre><p>
The debug enabled runtime system features lock violation checking,
assert checking and various sanity checks to help a developer ensure
correctness. Some of these features can be enabled on a normal beam
using appropriate configure options.
</p><p>
There are other types of runtime systems that can be built as well
using the similar steps just described.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ (cd $ERL_TOP/erts/emulator &amp;&amp; make $TYPE)
</code></pre><p>
where <strong>$TYPE</strong> is <strong>opt</strong>, <strong>gcov</strong>, <strong>gprof</strong>, <strong>debug</strong>, <strong>valgrind</strong>, or <strong>lcnt</strong>.
These different beam types are useful for debugging and profiling
purposes.
</p><a name="Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Installing"></a><h2>Installing</h2><ul><li> <p>Staged install using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/DESTDIR.html">DESTDIR</a>. You can perform the install
phase in a temporary directory and later move the installation into
its correct location by use of the <strong>DESTDIR</strong> variable:
</p> <pre><code class="">
$ make DESTDIR=&lt;tmp install dir&gt; install
</code></pre> <p>The installation will be created in a location prefixed by <strong>$DESTDIR</strong>.
It can, however, not be run from there. It needs to be moved into the
correct location before it can be run. If <strong>DESTDIR</strong> have not been set
but <strong>INSTALL_PREFIX</strong> has been set, <strong>DESTDIR</strong> will be set to
<strong>INSTALL_PREFIX</strong>. Note that <strong>INSTALL_PREFIX</strong> in pre R13B04 was buggy
and behaved as <strong>EXTRA_PREFIX</strong> (see below). There are lots of areas of
use for an installation procedure using <strong>DESTDIR</strong>, e.g. when creating
a package, cross compiling, etc. Here is an example where the
installation should be located under <strong>/opt/local</strong>:
</p> <pre><code class="">
$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/local
$ make
$ make DESTDIR=/tmp/erlang-build install
$ cd /tmp/erlang-build/opt/local
$     # gnu-tar is used in this example
$ tar -zcf /home/me/my-erlang-build.tgz *
$ su -
Password: *****
$ cd /opt/local
$ tar -zxf /home/me/my-erlang-build.tgz
</code></pre> </li><li> <p>Install using the <strong>release</strong> target. Instead of doing <strong>make install</strong> you
can create the installation in whatever directory you like using the
<strong>release</strong> target and run the <strong>Install</strong> script yourself. <strong>RELEASE_ROOT</strong>
is used for specifying the directory where the installation should be
created. This is what by default ends up under <strong>/usr/local/lib/erlang</strong>
if you do the install using <strong>make install</strong>. All installation paths
provided in the <strong>configure</strong> phase are ignored, as well as <strong>DESTDIR</strong>,
and <strong>INSTALL_PREFIX</strong>. If you want links from a specific <strong>bin</strong> directory
to the installation you have to set those up yourself. An example where
Erlang/OTP should be located at <strong>/home/me/OTP</strong>:
</p> <pre><code class="">
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make RELEASE_ROOT=/home/me/OTP release
$ cd /home/me/OTP
$ ./Install -minimal /home/me/OTP
$ mkdir -p /home/me/bin
$ cd /home/me/bin
$ ln -s /home/me/OTP/bin/erl erl
$ ln -s /home/me/OTP/bin/erlc erlc
$ ln -s /home/me/OTP/bin/escript escript
...
</code></pre> <p>The <strong>Install</strong> script should currently be invoked as follows in the
directory where it resides (the top directory):
</p> <pre><code class="">
$ ./Install [-cross] [-minimal|-sasl] &lt;ERL_ROOT&gt;
</code></pre> <p>where:
</p> <ul><li> <strong>-minimal</strong> Creates an installation that starts up a minimal amount of applications, i.e., only <strong>kernel</strong> and <strong>stdlib</strong> are started. The minimal system is normally enough, and is what <strong>make install</strong> uses. </li><li> <strong>-sasl</strong> Creates an installation that also starts up the <strong>sasl</strong> application. </li><li> <strong>-cross</strong> For cross compilation. Informs the install script that it is run on the build machine. </li><li> <strong>&lt;ERL_ROOT&gt;</strong> - The absolute path to the Erlang installation to use at run time. This is often the same as the current working directory, but does not have to be. It can follow any other path through the file system to the same directory. </li></ul> <p>If neither <strong>-minimal</strong>, nor <strong>-sasl</strong> is passed as argument you will be
prompted.
</p> </li><li> <p>Test install using <strong>EXTRA_PREFIX</strong>. The content of the <strong>EXTRA_PREFIX</strong>
variable will prefix all installation paths when doing <strong>make install</strong>.
Note that <strong>EXTRA_PREFIX</strong> is similar to <strong>DESTDIR</strong>, but it does <em>not</em> have
the same effect as <strong>DESTDIR</strong>. The installation can and have to be run
from the location specified by <strong>EXTRA_PREFIX</strong>. That is, it can be useful
if you want to try the system out, running test suites, etc, before doing
the real install without <strong>EXTRA_PREFIX</strong>.
</p> </li></ul><a name="Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Installing_Symbolic-Links-in-bindir"></a><h2>Symbolic Links in --bindir</h2><p>
When doing <strong>make install</strong> and the default installation prefix is used,
relative symbolic links will be created from <strong>/usr/local/bin</strong> to all public
Erlang/OTP executables in <strong>/usr/local/lib/erlang/bin</strong>. The installation phase
will try to create relative symbolic links as long as <strong>--bindir</strong> and the
Erlang bin directory, located under <strong>--libdir</strong>, both have <strong>--exec-prefix</strong> as
prefix. Where <strong>--exec-prefix</strong> defaults to <strong>--prefix</strong>. <strong>--prefix</strong>,
<strong>--exec-prefix</strong>, <strong>--bindir</strong>, and <strong>--libdir</strong> are all arguments that can be
passed to <strong>configure</strong>. One can force relative, or absolute links by passing
<strong>BINDIR_SYMLINKS=relative|absolute</strong> as arguments to <strong>make</strong> during the install
phase. Note that such a request might cause a failure if the request cannot
be satisfied.
</p><a name="Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Running"></a><h2>Running</h2><a name="Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Running_Using-HiPE"></a><h2>Using HiPE</h2><p>
HiPE supports the following system configurations:
</p><ul><li> <p>x86: All 32-bit and 64-bit mode processors should work.
</p> <ul><li> <p>Linux: Fedora Core is supported. Both 32-bit and 64-bit modes are
supported.
</p> <p>NPTL glibc is strongly preferred, or a LinuxThreads
glibc configured for "floating stacks". Old non-floating
stacks glibcs have a fundamental problem that makes HiPE
support and threads support mutually exclusive.
</p> </li><li> <p>Solaris: Solaris 10 (32-bit and 64-bit) and 9 (32-bit) are supported.
The build requires a version of the GNU C compiler (gcc)
that has been configured to use the GNU assembler (gas).
Sun's x86 assembler is emphatically <span class="strong">not</span> supported.
</p> </li><li> <p>FreeBSD: FreeBSD 6.1 and 6.2 in 32-bit and 64-bit modes should work.
</p> </li><li> <p>OS X/Darwin: Darwin 9.8.0 in 32-bit mode should work.
</p> </li></ul> </li><li> <p>PowerPC: All 32-bit 6xx/7xx(G3)/74xx(G4) processors should work. 32-bit
mode on 970 (G5) and POWER5 processors should work.
</p> <ul><li> Linux (Yellow Dog) and OS X 10.4 are supported. </li></ul> </li><li> <p>SPARC: All UltraSPARC processors running 32-bit user code should work.
</p> <ul><li> <p>Solaris 9 is supported. The build requires a <strong>gcc</strong> that has been
configured to use Sun's assembler and linker. Using the GNU assembler
but Sun's linker has been known to cause problems.
</p> </li><li> <p>Linux (Aurora) is supported.
</p> </li></ul> </li><li> <p>ARM: ARMv5TE (i.e. XScale) processors should work. Both big-endian and
little-endian modes are supported.
</p> <ul><li> Linux is supported. </li></ul> </li></ul><p>
HiPE is automatically enabled on the following systems:
</p><ul><li> x86 in 32-bit mode: Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD </li><li> x86 in 64-bit mode: Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD </li><li> PowerPC: Linux, Mac OSX </li><li> SPARC: Linux </li><li> ARM: Linux </li></ul><p>
On other supported systems, see <a href="#Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Configuring">Advanced Configure</a> on how to enable HiPE.
</p><p>
If you are running on a platform supporting HiPE and if you have not disabled
HiPE, you can compile a module into native code like this from the Erlang
shell:
</p><pre><code class="">
1&gt; c(Module, native).
</code></pre><p>
or
</p><pre><code class="">
1&gt; c(Module, [native|OtherOptions]).
</code></pre><p>
Using the erlc program, write like this
</p><pre><code class="">
$ erlc +native Module.erl
</code></pre><p>
The native code will be placed into the beam file and automatically loaded
when the beam file is loaded.
</p><p>
To add hipe options, write like this from the Erlang shell:
</p><pre><code class="">
1&gt; c(Module, [native,{hipe,HipeOptions}|MoreOptions]).
</code></pre><p>
Use <strong>hipe:help_options/0</strong> to print out the available options.
</p><pre><code class="">
1&gt; hipe:help_options().
</code></pre></body></html>
