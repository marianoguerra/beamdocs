This document describes how to build and install Erlang/OTP-22.
Erlang/OTP should be possible to build from source on any Unix/Linux system,
including OS X. You are advised to read the whole document
before attempting to build and install Erlang/OTP.
</p><p>
The source code can be downloaded from the official site of Erlang/OTP or GitHub.

The following instructions are for building <a href="http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_22.0-rc3.tar.gz">the released source tar ball</a>.
</p><p>
The variable <strong>$ERL_TOP</strong> will be mentioned a lot of times. It refers to
the top directory in the source tree. More information about <strong>$ERL_TOP</strong>
can be found in the <a href="#Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_make-and-ERLTOP">make and $ERL_TOP</a> section below. If you are
building in git you probably want to take a look at the <a href="#Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Building_Within-Git">Building in Git</a>
section below before proceeding.
</p><a name="How-to-Build-and-Install-ErlangOTP_Unpacking"></a><h3>Unpacking</h3><p>
Start by unpacking the Erlang/OTP distribution file with your GNU
compatible TAR program.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ tar -zxf otp_src_22.0-rc3.tar.gz    # Assuming bash/sh
</code></pre><p>
Now change directory into the base directory and set the <strong>$ERL_TOP</strong> variable.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ cd otp_src_22.0-rc3
$ export ERL_TOP=`pwd`    # Assuming bash/sh
</code></pre><a name="How-to-Build-and-Install-ErlangOTP_Configuring"></a><h3>Configuring</h3><p>
Run the following commands to configure the build:
</p><pre><code class="">
$ ./configure [ options ]
</code></pre><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>
If you are building Erlang/OTP from git you will need to run <strong>./otp_build autoconf</strong> to generate
the configure scripts.
</p></div><p>
By default, Erlang/OTP release will be installed in <strong>/usr/local/{bin,lib/erlang}</strong>.
If you for instance don't have the permission to install in the standard location,
you can install Erlang/OTP somewhere else. For example, to install in
<strong>/opt/erlang/22.0-rc3/{bin,lib/erlang}</strong>, use the <strong>--prefix=/opt/erlang/22.0-rc3</strong> option.
</p><p>
On some platforms Perl may behave strangely if certain locales are
set. If you get errors when building, try setting the LANG variable:
</p><pre><code class="">
$ export LANG=C   # Assuming bash/sh
</code></pre><a name="How-to-Build-and-Install-ErlangOTP_Building"></a><h3>Building</h3><p>
Build the Erlang/OTP release.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ make
</code></pre><a name="How-to-Build-and-Install-ErlangOTP_Testing"></a><h3>Testing</h3><p>
Before installation you should test whether your build is working properly
by running our smoke test. The smoke test is a subset of the complete Erlang/OTP test suites.
First you will need to build and release the test suites.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ make release_tests
</code></pre><p>
This creates an additional folder in <strong>$ERL_TOP/release</strong> called <strong>tests</strong>.
Now, it's time to start the smoke test.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ cd release/tests/test_server
$ $ERL_TOP/bin/erl -s ts install -s ts smoke_test batch -s init stop
</code></pre><p>
To verify that everything is ok you should open <strong>$ERL_TOP/release/tests/test_server/index.html</strong>
in your web browser and make sure that there are zero failed test cases.
</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>
On builds without <strong>crypto</strong>, <strong>ssl</strong> and <strong>ssh</strong> there is a failed test case
for undefined functions. Verify that the failed test case log only shows calls
to skipped applications.
</p></div><a name="How-to-Build-and-Install-ErlangOTP_Installing"></a><h3>Installing</h3><p>
You are now ready to install the Erlang/OTP release!
The following command will install the release on your system.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ make install
</code></pre><a name="How-to-Build-and-Install-ErlangOTP_Running"></a><h3>Running</h3><p>
You should now have a working release of Erlang/OTP!
Jump to <a href="../system_principles/system_principles">System Principles</a> for instructions on running Erlang/OTP.
</p><a name="How-to-Build-and-Install-ErlangOTP_How-to-Build-the-Documentation"></a><h3>How to Build the Documentation</h3><p>
Make sure you're in the top directory in the source tree.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ cd $ERL_TOP
</code></pre><p>
If you have just built Erlang/OTP in the current source tree, you have
already ran <strong>configure</strong> and do not need to do this again; otherwise, run
<strong>configure</strong>.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ ./configure [Configure Args]
</code></pre><p>
When building the documentation you need a full Erlang/OTP-22.0-rc3 system in
the <strong>$PATH</strong>.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ export PATH=$ERL_TOP/bin:$PATH     # Assuming bash/sh
</code></pre><p>
For the FOP print formatter, two steps must be taken:
</p><ul><li> <p>Adding the location of your installation of <strong>fop</strong> in <strong>$FOP_HOME</strong>.
</p> <pre><code class="">
$ export FOP_HOME=/path/to/fop/dir # Assuming bash/sh
</code></pre> </li><li> <p>Adding the <strong>fop</strong> script (in <strong>$FOP_HOME</strong>) to your <strong>$PATH</strong>, either by adding <strong>$FOP_HOME</strong> to <strong>$PATH</strong>, or by copying the <strong>fop</strong> script to a directory already in your <strong>$PATH</strong>.
</p> </li></ul><p>
Build the documentation.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ make docs
</code></pre><a name="How-to-Build-and-Install-ErlangOTP_How-to-Build-the-Documentation_Build-Issues"></a><h3>Build Issues</h3><p>
We have sometimes experienced problems with Oracle's <strong>java</strong> running out of
memory when running <strong>fop</strong>. Increasing the amount of memory available
as follows has in our case solved the problem.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ export FOP_OPTS="-Xmx&lt;Installed amount of RAM in MB&gt;m"
</code></pre><p>

</p><ul><li> <a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/0.95/running.html#memory">http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/0.95/running.html#memory</a>. </li></ul><a name="How-to-Build-and-Install-ErlangOTP_How-to-Install-the-Documentation"></a><h3>How to Install the Documentation</h3><p>
The documentation can be installed either using the <strong>install-docs</strong> target,
or using the <strong>release_docs</strong> target.
</p><ul><li> <p>If you have installed Erlang/OTP using the <strong>install</strong> target, install
the documentation using the <strong>install-docs</strong> target. Install locations
determined by <strong>configure</strong> will be used. <strong>$DESTDIR</strong> can be used the
same way as when doing <strong>make install</strong>.
</p> <pre><code class="">
$ make install-docs
</code></pre> </li><li> <p>If you have installed Erlang/OTP using the <strong>release</strong> target, install
the documentation using the <strong>release_docs</strong> target. You typically want
to use the same <strong>RELEASE_ROOT</strong> as when invoking <strong>make release</strong>.
</p> <pre><code class="">
$ make release_docs RELEASE_ROOT=&lt;release dir&gt;
</code></pre> </li></ul><a name="How-to-Build-and-Install-ErlangOTP_Accessing-the-Documentation"></a><h3>Accessing the Documentation</h3><p>
After installation you can access the documentation by
</p><ul><li> <p>Reading man pages. Make sure that <strong>erl</strong> is referring to the
installed version. For example <strong>/usr/local/bin/erl</strong>.
Try viewing at the man page for Mnesia
</p> <pre><code class="">
$ erl -man mnesia
</code></pre> </li><li> <p>Browsing the html pages by loading the page <strong>/usr/local/lib/erlang/doc/erlang/index.html</strong>
or <strong>&lt;BaseDir&gt;/lib/erlang/doc/erlang/index.html</strong> if the prefix option has been used.
</p> </li></ul><a name="How-to-Build-and-Install-ErlangOTP_How-to-Install-the-Preformatted-Documentation"></a><h3>How to Install the Pre-formatted Documentation</h3><p>
Pre-formatted <a href="http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_doc_html_22.0-rc3.tar.gz">html documentation</a> and <a href="http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_doc_man_22.0-rc3.tar.gz">man pages</a> can be downloaded from
</p><ul><li> <a href="http://www.erlang.org/download.html">http://www.erlang.org/download.html</a>. </li></ul><p>
Extract the html archive in the installation directory.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ cd &lt;ReleaseDir&gt;
$ tar -zxf otp_html_22.0-rc3.tar.gz
</code></pre><p>
For <strong>erl -man &lt;page&gt;</strong> to work the Unix manual pages have to be
installed in the same way, i.e.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ cd &lt;ReleaseDir&gt;
$ tar -zxf otp_man_22.0-rc3.tar.gz
</code></pre><p>
Where <strong>&lt;ReleaseDir&gt;</strong> is
</p><ul><li> <strong>&lt;PrefixDir&gt;/lib/erlang</strong> if you have installed Erlang/OTP using <strong>make install</strong>. </li><li> <strong>$DESTDIR&lt;PrefixDir&gt;/lib/erlang</strong> if you have installed Erlang/OTP using <strong>make install DESTDIR=&lt;TmpInstallDir&gt;</strong>. </li><li> <strong>RELEASE_ROOT</strong> if you have installed using <strong>make release RELEASE_ROOT=&lt;ReleaseDir&gt;</strong>. </li></ul><a name="Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP"></a><h3>Advanced configuration and build of Erlang/OTP</h3><p>
If you want to tailor your Erlang/OTP build and installation, please read
on for detailed information about the individual steps.
</p><a name="Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_make-and-ERLTOP"></a><h3>make and $ERL_TOP</h3><p>
All the makefiles in the entire directory tree use the environment
variable <strong>ERL_TOP</strong> to find the absolute path of the installation. The
<strong>configure</strong> script will figure this out and set it in the top level
Makefile (which, when building, it will pass on). However, when
developing it is sometimes convenient to be able to run make in a
subdirectory. To do this you must set the <strong>ERL_TOP</strong> variable
before you run make.
</p><p>
For example, assume your GNU make program is called <strong>make</strong> and you
want to rebuild the application <strong>STDLIB</strong>, then you could do:
</p><pre><code class="">
$ cd lib/stdlib; env ERL_TOP=&lt;Dir&gt; make
</code></pre><p>
where <strong>&lt;Dir&gt;</strong> would be what you find <strong>ERL_TOP</strong> is set to in the top level
Makefile.
</p><a name="Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_otpbuild-vs-configuremake"></a><h3>otp_build vs configure/make</h3><p>
Building Erlang/OTP can be done either by using the <strong>$ERL_TOP/otp_build</strong>
script, or by invoking <strong>$ERL_TOP/configure</strong> and <strong>make</strong> directly. Building using
<strong>otp_build</strong> is easier since it involves fewer steps, but the <strong>otp_build</strong> build
procedure is not as flexible as the <strong>configure</strong>/<strong>make</strong> build procedure. The binary
releases for Windows that we deliver are built using <strong>otp_build</strong>.
</p><a name="Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Configuring"></a><h3>Configuring</h3><p>
The configure script is created by the GNU autoconf utility, which
checks for system specific features and then creates a number of makefiles.
</p><p>
The configure script allows you to customize a number of parameters;
type <strong>./configure --help</strong> or <strong>./configure --help=recursive</strong> for details.
<strong>./configure --help=recursive</strong> will give help for all <strong>configure</strong> scripts in
all applications.
</p><p>
One of the things you can specify is where Erlang/OTP should be installed. By
default Erlang/OTP will be installed in <strong>/usr/local/{bin,lib/erlang}</strong>.
To keep the same structure but install in a different place, <strong>&lt;Dir&gt;</strong> say,
use the <strong>--prefix</strong> argument like this: <strong>./configure --prefix=&lt;Dir&gt;</strong>.
</p><p>
Some of the available <strong>configure</strong> options are:
</p><ul><li> <strong>--prefix=PATH</strong> - Specify installation prefix. </li><li> <strong>--disable-parallel-configure</strong> - Disable parallel execution of <strong>configure</strong> scripts (parallel execution is enabled by default) </li><li> <strong>--{enable,disable}-kernel-poll</strong> - Kernel poll support (enabled by default if possible) </li><li> <strong>--{enable,disable}-hipe</strong> - HiPE support (enabled by default on supported platforms) </li><li> <strong>--{enable,disable}-fp-exceptions</strong> - Floating point exceptions (an optimization for floating point operations). The default differs depending on operating system and hardware platform. Note that by enabling this you might get a seemingly working system that sometimes fail on floating point operations. </li><li> <strong>--enable-m64-build</strong> - Build 64-bit binaries using the <strong>-m64</strong> flag to <strong>(g)cc</strong> </li><li> <strong>--enable-m32-build</strong> - Build 32-bit binaries using the <strong>-m32</strong> flag to <strong>(g)cc</strong> </li><li> <strong>--with-assumed-cache-line-size=SIZE</strong> - Set assumed cache-line size in bytes. Default is 64. Valid values are powers of two between and including 16 and 8192. The runtime system use this value in order to try to avoid false sharing. A too large value wastes memory. A to small value will increase the amount of false sharing. </li><li> <strong>--{with,without}-termcap</strong> - termcap (without implies that only the old Erlang shell can be used) </li><li> <strong>--with-javac=JAVAC</strong> - Specify Java compiler to use </li><li> <strong>--{with,without}-javac</strong> - Java compiler (without implies that the <strong>jinterface</strong> application won't be built) </li><li> <strong>--{enable,disable}-dynamic-ssl-lib</strong> - Dynamic OpenSSL libraries </li><li> <strong>--{enable,disable}-builtin-zlib</strong> - Use the built-in source for zlib. </li><li> <strong>--{with,without}-ssl</strong> - OpenSSL (without implies that the <strong>crypto</strong>, <strong>ssh</strong>, and <strong>ssl</strong> won't be built) </li><li> <strong>--with-ssl=PATH</strong> - Specify location of OpenSSL include and lib </li><li> <strong>--with-ssl-incl=PATH</strong> - Location of OpenSSL <strong>include</strong> directory, if different than specified by <strong>--with-ssl=PATH</strong> </li><li> <strong>--with-ssl-rpath=yes|no|PATHS</strong> - Runtime library path for OpenSSL. Default is <strong>yes</strong>, which equates to a number of standard locations. If <strong>no</strong>, then no runtime library paths will be used. Anything else should be a comma separated list of paths. </li><li> <strong>--with-libatomic_ops=PATH</strong> - Use the <strong>libatomic_ops</strong> library for atomic memory accesses. If <strong>configure</strong> should inform you about no native atomic implementation available, you typically want to try using the <strong>libatomic_ops</strong> library. It can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/ivmai/libatomic_ops/">https://github.com/ivmai/libatomic_ops/</a>. </li><li> <strong>--disable-smp-require-native-atomics</strong> - By default <strong>configure</strong> will fail if an SMP runtime system is about to be built, and no implementation for native atomic memory accesses can be found. If this happens, you are encouraged to find a native atomic implementation that can be used, e.g., using <strong>libatomic_ops</strong>, but by passing <strong>--disable-smp-require-native-atomics</strong> you can build using a fallback implementation based on mutexes or spinlocks. Performance of the SMP runtime system will however suffer immensely without an implementation for native atomic memory accesses. </li><li> <strong>--enable-static-{nifs,drivers}</strong> - To allow usage of nifs and drivers on OSs that do not support dynamic linking of libraries it is possible to statically link nifs and drivers with the main Erlang VM binary. This is done by passing a comma separated list to the archives that you want to statically link. e.g. <strong>--enable-static-nifs=/home/$USER/my_nif.a</strong>. The path has to be absolute and the name of the archive has to be the same as the module, i.e. <strong>my_nif</strong> in the example above. This is also true for drivers, but then it is the driver name that has to be the same as the filename. You also have to define <strong>STATIC_ERLANG_{NIF,DRIVER}</strong> when compiling the .o files for the nif/driver. If your nif/driver depends on some other dynamic library, you now have to link that to the Erlang VM binary. This is easily achieved by passing <strong>LIBS=-llibname</strong> to configure. </li><li> <strong>--without-$app</strong> - By default all applications in Erlang/OTP will be included in a release. If this is not wanted it is possible to specify that Erlang/OTP should be compiled without one or more applications, i.e. <strong>--without-wx</strong>. There is no automatic dependency handling between applications. If you disable an application that another application depends on, you also have to disable the dependant application. </li><li> <strong>--enable-gettimeofday-as-os-system-time</strong> - Force usage of <strong>gettimeofday()</strong> for OS system time. </li><li> <strong>--enable-prefer-elapsed-monotonic-time-during-suspend</strong> - Prefer an OS monotonic time source with elapsed time during suspend. </li><li> <strong>--disable-prefer-elapsed-monotonic-time-during-suspend</strong> - Do not prefer an OS monotonic time source with elapsed time during suspend. </li><li> <strong>--with-clock-resolution=high|low</strong> - Try to find clock sources for OS system time, and OS monotonic time with higher or lower resolution than chosen by default. Note that both alternatives may have a negative impact on the performance and scalability compared to the default clock sources chosen. </li><li> <strong>--disable-saved-compile-time</strong> - Disable saving of compile date and time in the emulator binary. </li></ul><p>
If you or your system has special requirements please read the <strong>Makefile</strong> for
additional configuration information.
</p><a name="Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Configuring_Atomic-Memory-Operations-and-the-VM"></a><h3>Atomic Memory Operations and the VM</h3><p>
The VM with SMP support makes quite a heavy use of atomic memory operations.
An implementation providing native atomic memory operations is therefore very
important when building Erlang/OTP. By default the VM will refuse to build
if native atomic memory operations are not available.
</p><p>
Erlang/OTP itself provides implementations of native atomic memory operations
that can be used when compiling with a <strong>gcc</strong> compatible compiler for 32/64-bit
x86, 32/64-bit SPARC V9, 32-bit PowerPC, or 32-bit Tile. When compiling with
a <strong>gcc</strong> compatible compiler for other architectures, the VM may be able to make
use of native atomic operations using the <strong>__atomic_*</strong> builtins (may be
available when using a <strong>gcc</strong> of at least version 4.7) and/or using the
<strong>__sync_*</strong> builtins (may be available when using a <strong>gcc</strong> of at least version
4.1). If only the <strong>gcc</strong>'s <strong>__sync_*</strong> builtins are available, the performance
will suffer. Such a configuration should only be used as a last resort. When
compiling on Windows using a MicroSoft Visual C++ compiler native atomic
memory operations are provided by Windows APIs.
</p><p>
Native atomic implementation in the order preferred:
</p><ul><li> The implementation provided by Erlang/OTP. </li><li> The API provided by Windows. </li><li> The implementation based on the <strong>gcc</strong> <strong>__atomic_*</strong> builtins. </li><li> If none of the above are available for your architecture/compiler, you are recommended to build and install <a href="https://github.com/ivmai/libatomic_ops/">libatomic_ops</a> before building Erlang/OTP. The <strong>libatomic_ops</strong> library provides native atomic memory operations for a variety of architectures and compilers. When building Erlang/OTP you need to inform the build system of where the <strong>libatomic_ops</strong> library is installed using the <strong>--with-libatomic_ops=PATH</strong> <strong>configure</strong> switch. </li><li> As a last resort, the implementation solely based on the <strong>gcc</strong> <strong>__sync_*</strong> builtins. This will however cause lots of expensive and unnecessary memory barrier instructions to be issued. That is, performance will suffer. The <strong>configure</strong> script will warn at the end of its execution if it cannot find any other alternative than this. </li></ul><a name="Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Building"></a><h3>Building</h3><p>
Building Erlang/OTP on a relatively fast computer takes approximately
5 minutes. To speed it up, you can utilize parallel make with the <strong>-j&lt;num_jobs&gt;</strong> option.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ export MAKEFLAGS=-j8    # Assuming bash/sh
$ make
</code></pre><p>
If you've upgraded the source with a patch you may need to clean up from previous
builds before the new build.
Make sure to read the <a href="#Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Building_Prebuilt-Source-Release">Pre-built Source Release</a> section below before doing a <strong>make clean</strong>.
</p><a name="Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Building_Within-Git"></a><h3>Within Git</h3><p>
When building in a Git working directory you also have to have a GNU <strong>autoconf</strong>
of at least version 2.59 on your system, because you need to generate the
<strong>configure</strong> scripts before you can start building.
</p><p>
The <strong>configure</strong> scripts are generated by invoking <strong>./otp_build autoconf</strong> in
the <strong>$ERL_TOP</strong> directory. The <strong>configure</strong> scripts also have to be regenerated
when a <strong>configure.in</strong> or <strong>aclocal.m4</strong> file has been modified. Note that when
checking out a branch a <strong>configure.in</strong> or <strong>aclocal.m4</strong> file may change
content, and you may therefore have to regenerate the <strong>configure</strong> scripts
when checking out a branch. Regenerated <strong>configure</strong> scripts imply that you
have to run <strong>configure</strong> and build again.
</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>
Running <strong>./otp_build autoconf</strong> is <span class="strong">not</span> needed when building
an unmodified version of the released source.

name (this is configured in <strong>/etc/hostconfig</strong>). Otherwise you might experience
problems when running distributed systems.
</p><p>
If you develop linked-in drivers (shared library) you need to link using
<strong>gcc</strong> and the flags <strong>-bundle -flat_namespace -undefined suppress</strong>. You also
include <strong>-fno-common</strong> in <strong>CFLAGS</strong> when compiling. Use <strong>.so</strong> as the library
suffix.
</p><p>
If you have Xcode 4.3, or later, you will also need to download
"Command Line Tools" via the Downloads preference pane in Xcode.
</p><a name="Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Building_Building-with-wxErlang"></a><h3>Building with wxErlang</h3><p>
If you want to build the <strong>wx</strong> application, you will need to get wxWidgets-3.0
(<strong>wxWidgets-3.0.3.tar.bz2</strong> from <a href="https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/download/v3.0.3/wxWidgets-3.0.3.tar.bz2">https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/download/v3.0.3/wxWidgets-3.0.3.tar.bz2</a>) or get it from github with bug fixes:
</p><pre><code class="">
$ git clone --branch WX_3_0_BRANCH git@github.com:wxWidgets/wxWidgets.git
</code></pre><p>
The wxWidgets-3.1 version should also work if 2.8 compatibility is enabled,
add <strong>--enable-compat28</strong> to configure commands below.
</p><p>
Configure and build wxWidgets (shared library on linux):
</p><pre><code class="">
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
$ make &amp;&amp; sudo make install
$ export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
</code></pre><p>
Configure and build wxWidgets (static library on linux):
</p><pre><code class="">
$ export CFLAGS=-fPIC
$ export CXXFLAGS=-fPIC
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --disable-shared
$ make &amp;&amp; sudo make install
$ export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
</code></pre><p>
Configure and build wxWidgets (on Mavericks - 10.9):
</p><pre><code class="">
$ ./configure --with-cocoa --prefix=/usr/local
or without support for old versions and with static libs
$ ./configure --with-cocoa --prefix=/usr/local --with-macosx-version-min=10.9 --disable-shared
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
</code></pre><p>
Check that you got the correct wx-config
</p><pre><code class="">
$ which wx-config &amp;&amp; wx-config --version-full

$ sudo make install
</code></pre><a name="Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Building_Prebuilt-Source-Release"></a><h3>Pre-built Source Release</h3><p>
The source release is delivered with a lot of platform independent
build results already pre-built. If you want to remove these pre-built
files, invoke <strong>./otp_build remove_prebuilt_files</strong> from the <strong>$ERL_TOP</strong>
directory. After you have done this, you can build exactly the same way
as before, but the build process will take a much longer time.
</p><div class="alert alert-warning"><h4 class="alert-heading">Warning</h4><p>
Doing <strong>make clean</strong> in an arbitrary directory of the source
tree, may remove files needed for bootstrapping the build.
</p><p>
Doing <strong>./otp_build save_bootstrap</strong> from the <strong>$ERL_TOP</strong> directory before
doing <strong>make clean</strong> will ensure that it will be possible to build after
doing <strong>make clean</strong>. <strong>./otp_build save_bootstrap</strong> will be invoked
automatically when <strong>make</strong> is invoked from <strong>$ERL_TOP</strong> with either the
<strong>clean</strong> target, or the default target. It is also automatically invoked
if <strong>./otp_build remove_prebuilt_files</strong> is invoked.
</p><p>
If you need to verify the bootstrap beam files match the provided
source files, use <strong>./otp_build update_primary</strong> to create a new commit that
contains differences, if any exist.
</p></div><a name="Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Building_How-to-Build-a-Debug-Enabled-Erlang-RunTime-System"></a><h3>How to Build a Debug Enabled Erlang RunTime System</h3><p>
After completing all the normal building steps described above a debug
enabled runtime system can be built. To do this you have to change
directory to <strong>$ERL_TOP/erts/emulator</strong> and execute:
</p><pre><code class="">
$ (cd $ERL_TOP/erts/emulator &amp;&amp; make debug)
</code></pre><p>
This will produce a  beam.smp.debug executable. The
file are installed along side with the normal (opt) version <strong>beam.smp</strong>.
</p><p>
To start the debug enabled runtime system execute:
</p><pre><code class="">
$ $ERL_TOP/bin/cerl -debug
</code></pre><p>
The debug enabled runtime system features lock violation checking,
assert checking and various sanity checks to help a developer ensure
correctness. Some of these features can be enabled on a normal beam
using appropriate configure options.
</p><p>
There are other types of runtime systems that can be built as well
using the similar steps just described.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ (cd $ERL_TOP/erts/emulator &amp;&amp; make $TYPE)
</code></pre><p>
where <strong>$TYPE</strong> is <strong>opt</strong>, <strong>gcov</strong>, <strong>gprof</strong>, <strong>debug</strong>, <strong>valgrind</strong>, or <strong>lcnt</strong>.
These different beam types are useful for debugging and profiling
purposes.
</p><a name="Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Installing"></a><h3>Installing</h3><ul><li> <p>Staged install using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/DESTDIR.html">DESTDIR</a>. You can perform the install
phase in a temporary directory and later move the installation into
its correct location by use of the <strong>DESTDIR</strong> variable:
</p> <pre><code class="">
$ make DESTDIR=&lt;tmp install dir&gt; install
</code></pre> <p>The installation will be created in a location prefixed by <strong>$DESTDIR</strong>.
It can, however, not be run from there. It needs to be moved into the
correct location before it can be run. If <strong>DESTDIR</strong> have not been set
but <strong>INSTALL_PREFIX</strong> has been set, <strong>DESTDIR</strong> will be set to
<strong>INSTALL_PREFIX</strong>. Note that <strong>INSTALL_PREFIX</strong> in pre R13B04 was buggy
and behaved as <strong>EXTRA_PREFIX</strong> (see below). There are lots of areas of
use for an installation procedure using <strong>DESTDIR</strong>, e.g. when creating
a package, cross compiling, etc. Here is an example where the
installation should be located under <strong>/opt/local</strong>:
</p> <pre><code class="">
$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/local
$ make
$ make DESTDIR=/tmp/erlang-build install
$ cd /tmp/erlang-build/opt/local
$     # gnu-tar is used in this example
$ tar -zcf /home/me/my-erlang-build.tgz *
$ su -
Password: *****
$ cd /opt/local
$ tar -zxf /home/me/my-erlang-build.tgz
</code></pre> </li><li> <p>Install using the <strong>release</strong> target. Instead of doing <strong>make install</strong> you
can create the installation in whatever directory you like using the
<strong>release</strong> target and run the <strong>Install</strong> script yourself. <strong>RELEASE_ROOT</strong>
is used for specifying the directory where the installation should be
created. This is what by default ends up under <strong>/usr/local/lib/erlang</strong>
if you do the install using <strong>make install</strong>. All installation paths
provided in the <strong>configure</strong> phase are ignored, as well as <strong>DESTDIR</strong>,
and <strong>INSTALL_PREFIX</strong>. If you want links from a specific <strong>bin</strong> directory
to the installation you have to set those up yourself. An example where
Erlang/OTP should be located at <strong>/home/me/OTP</strong>:
</p> <pre><code class="">
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make RELEASE_ROOT=/home/me/OTP release
$ cd /home/me/OTP
$ ./Install -minimal /home/me/OTP
$ mkdir -p /home/me/bin
$ cd /home/me/bin
$ ln -s /home/me/OTP/bin/erl erl
$ ln -s /home/me/OTP/bin/erlc erlc
$ ln -s /home/me/OTP/bin/escript escript
...
</code></pre> <p>The <strong>Install</strong> script should currently be invoked as follows in the
directory where it resides (the top directory):
</p> <pre><code class="">
$ ./Install [-cross] [-minimal|-sasl] &lt;ERL_ROOT&gt;
</code></pre> <p>where:
</p> <ul><li> <strong>-minimal</strong> Creates an installation that starts up a minimal amount of applications, i.e., only <strong>kernel</strong> and <strong>stdlib</strong> are started. The minimal system is normally enough, and is what <strong>make install</strong> uses. </li><li> <strong>-sasl</strong> Creates an installation that also starts up the <strong>sasl</strong> application. </li><li> <strong>-cross</strong> For cross compilation. Informs the install script that it is run on the build machine. </li><li> <strong>&lt;ERL_ROOT&gt;</strong> - The absolute path to the Erlang installation to use at run time. This is often the same as the current working directory, but does not have to be. It can follow any other path through the file system to the same directory. </li></ul> <p>If neither <strong>-minimal</strong>, nor <strong>-sasl</strong> is passed as argument you will be
prompted.
</p> </li><li> <p>Test install using <strong>EXTRA_PREFIX</strong>. The content of the <strong>EXTRA_PREFIX</strong>
variable will prefix all installation paths when doing <strong>make install</strong>.
Note that <strong>EXTRA_PREFIX</strong> is similar to <strong>DESTDIR</strong>, but it does <em>not</em> have
the same effect as <strong>DESTDIR</strong>. The installation can and have to be run
from the location specified by <strong>EXTRA_PREFIX</strong>. That is, it can be useful
if you want to try the system out, running test suites, etc, before doing
the real install without <strong>EXTRA_PREFIX</strong>.
</p> </li></ul><a name="Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Installing_Symbolic-Links-in-bindir"></a><h3>Symbolic Links in --bindir</h3><p>
When doing <strong>make install</strong> and the default installation prefix is used,
relative symbolic links will be created from <strong>/usr/local/bin</strong> to all public
Erlang/OTP executables in <strong>/usr/local/lib/erlang/bin</strong>. The installation phase
will try to create relative symbolic links as long as <strong>--bindir</strong> and the
Erlang bin directory, located under <strong>--libdir</strong>, both have <strong>--exec-prefix</strong> as
prefix. Where <strong>--exec-prefix</strong> defaults to <strong>--prefix</strong>. <strong>--prefix</strong>,
<strong>--exec-prefix</strong>, <strong>--bindir</strong>, and <strong>--libdir</strong> are all arguments that can be
passed to <strong>configure</strong>. One can force relative, or absolute links by passing
<strong>BINDIR_SYMLINKS=relative|absolute</strong> as arguments to <strong>make</strong> during the install
phase. Note that such a request might cause a failure if the request cannot
be satisfied.
</p><a name="Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Running"></a><h3>Running</h3><a name="Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Running_Using-HiPE"></a><h3>Using HiPE</h3><p>
HiPE supports the following system configurations:
</p><ul><li> <p>x86: All 32-bit and 64-bit mode processors should work.
</p> <ul><li> <p>Linux: Fedora Core is supported. Both 32-bit and 64-bit modes are
supported.
</p> <p>NPTL glibc is strongly preferred, or a LinuxThreads
glibc configured for "floating stacks". Old non-floating
stacks glibcs have a fundamental problem that makes HiPE
support and threads support mutually exclusive.
</p> </li><li> <p>Solaris: Solaris 10 (32-bit and 64-bit) and 9 (32-bit) are supported.
The build requires a version of the GNU C compiler (gcc)
that has been configured to use the GNU assembler (gas).
Sun's x86 assembler is emphatically <span class="strong">not</span> supported.
</p> </li><li> <p>FreeBSD: FreeBSD 6.1 and 6.2 in 32-bit and 64-bit modes should work.
</p> </li><li> <p>OS X/Darwin: Darwin 9.8.0 in 32-bit mode should work.
</p> </li></ul> </li><li> <p>PowerPC: All 32-bit 6xx/7xx(G3)/74xx(G4) processors should work. 32-bit
mode on 970 (G5) and POWER5 processors should work.
</p> <ul><li> Linux (Yellow Dog) and OS X 10.4 are supported. </li></ul> </li><li> <p>SPARC: All UltraSPARC processors running 32-bit user code should work.
</p> <ul><li> <p>Solaris 9 is supported. The build requires a <strong>gcc</strong> that has been
configured to use Sun's assembler and linker. Using the GNU assembler
but Sun's linker has been known to cause problems.
</p> </li><li> <p>Linux (Aurora) is supported.
</p> </li></ul> </li><li> <p>ARM: ARMv5TE (i.e. XScale) processors should work. Both big-endian and
little-endian modes are supported.
</p> <ul><li> Linux is supported. </li></ul> </li></ul><p>
HiPE is automatically enabled on the following systems:
</p><ul><li> x86 in 32-bit mode: Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD </li><li> x86 in 64-bit mode: Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD </li><li> PowerPC: Linux, Mac OSX </li><li> SPARC: Linux </li><li> ARM: Linux </li></ul><p>
On other supported systems, see <a href="#Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP_Configuring">Advanced Configure</a> on how to enable HiPE.
</p><p>
If you are running on a platform supporting HiPE and if you have not disabled
HiPE, you can compile a module into native code like this from the Erlang
shell:
</p><pre><code class="">
1&gt; c(Module, native).
</code></pre><p>
or
</p><pre><code class="">
1&gt; c(Module, [native|OtherOptions]).
</code></pre><p>
Using the erlc program, write like this
</p><pre><code class="">
$ erlc +native Module.erl
</code></pre><p>
The native code will be placed into the beam file and automatically loaded
when the beam file is loaded.
</p><p>
To add hipe options, write like this from the Erlang shell:
</p><pre><code class="">
1&gt; c(Module, [native,{hipe,HipeOptions}|MoreOptions]).
</code></pre><p>
Use <strong>hipe:help_options/0</strong> to print out the available options.
</p><pre><code class="">
1&gt; hipe:help_options().

This document describes how to cross compile Erlang/OTP-22. 
You are advised to read the whole document before attempting to cross
compile Erlang/OTP. However, before reading this document, you should read
the <a href="INSTALL">$ERL_TOP/HOWTO/INSTALL.md</a> document which describes building and installing
Erlang/OTP in general. <strong>$ERL_TOP</strong> is the top directory in the source tree.
</p><a name="Introduction_otpbuild-Versus-configuremake"></a><h3>otp_build Versus configure/make</h3><p>
Building Erlang/OTP can be done either by using the <strong>$ERL_TOP/otp_build</strong>
script, or by invoking <strong>$ERL_TOP/configure</strong> and <strong>make</strong> directly. Building using
<strong>otp_build</strong> is easier since it involves fewer steps, but the <strong>otp_build</strong> build
procedure is not as flexible as the <strong>configure</strong>/<strong>make</strong> build procedure. Note
that <strong>otp_build configure</strong> will produce a default configuration that differs
from what <strong>configure</strong> will produce by default. For example, currently
<strong>--disable-dynamic-ssl-lib</strong> is added to the <strong>configure</strong> command line arguments
unless <strong>--enable-dynamic-ssl-lib</strong> has been explicitly passed. The binary
releases that we deliver are built using <strong>otp_build</strong>.  The defaults used by
<strong>otp_build configure</strong> may change at any time without prior notice.
</p><a name="Introduction_Cross-Configuration"></a><h3>Cross Configuration</h3><p>
The <strong>$ERL_TOP/xcomp/erl-xcomp.conf.template</strong> file contains all available cross
configuration variables and can be used as a template when creating a cross
compilation configuration. All <a href="#Currently-Used-Configuration-Variables">cross configuration variables</a> are also
listed at the end of this document. For examples of working cross
configurations see the <strong>$ERL_TOP/xcomp/erl-xcomp-TileraMDE2.0-tilepro.conf</strong>
file and the <strong>$ERL_TOP/xcomp/erl-xcomp-x86_64-saf-linux-gnu.conf</strong> file. If the
default behavior of a variable is satisfactory, the variable does not need to
be set. However, the <strong>configure</strong> script will issue a warning when a default
value is used. When a variable has been set, no warning will be issued.
</p><p>
A cross configuration file can be passed to <strong>otp_build configure</strong> using the
<strong>--xcomp-conf</strong> command line argument. Note that <strong>configure</strong> does not accept
this command line argument. When using the <strong>configure</strong> script directly, pass
the configuration variables as arguments to <strong>configure</strong> using a
<strong>&lt;VARIABLE&gt;=&lt;VALUE&gt;</strong> syntax. Variables can also be passed as environment
variables to <strong>configure</strong>. However, if you pass the configuration in the
environment, make sure to unset all of these environment variables before
invoking <strong>make</strong>; otherwise, the environment variables might set make variables
in some applications, or parts of some applications, and you may end up with
an erroneously configured build. 
</p><a name="Introduction_What-can-be-Cross-Compiled"></a><h3>What can be Cross Compiled?</h3><p>
All Erlang/OTP applications except the <strong>wx</strong> application can be cross compiled.
The build of the <strong>wx</strong> driver will currently be automatically disabled when
cross compiling.
</p><a name="Introduction_Compatibility"></a><h3>Compatibility</h3><p>
The build system, including cross compilation configuration variables used,
may be subject to non backward compatible changes without prior notice.
Current cross build system has been tested when cross compiling some Linux/GNU
systems, but has only been partly tested for more esoteric platforms. The
VxWorks example file is highly dependent on our environment and is here more
or less only for internal use.
</p><a name="Introduction_Patches"></a><h3>Patches</h3><p>
Please submit any patches for cross compiling in a way consistent with this
system. All input is welcome as we have a very limited set of cross compiling
environments to test with. If a new configuration variable is needed, add it
to <strong>$ERL_TOP/xcomp/erl-xcomp.conf.template</strong>, and use it in <strong>configure.in</strong>.
Other files that might need to be updated are:
</p><ul><li> <strong>$ERL_TOP/xcomp/erl-xcomp-vars.sh</strong> </li><li> <strong>$ERL_TOP/erl-build-tool-vars.sh</strong> </li><li> <strong>$ERL_TOP/erts/aclocal.m4</strong> </li><li> <strong>$ERL_TOP/xcomp/README.md</strong> </li><li> <strong>$ERL_TOP/xcomp/erl-xcomp-*.conf</strong> </li></ul><p>
Note that this might be an incomplete list of files that need to be updated.

</p><a name="Build-and-Install-Procedure"></a><h3>Build and Install Procedure</h3><p>
If you are building in Git, you want to read the <a href="./INSTALL#How-to-Build-and-Install-ErlangOTP">Building in Git</a> section
of <a href="INSTALL">$ERL_TOP/HOWTO/INSTALL.md</a> before proceeding.
</p><p>
We will first go through the <strong>configure</strong>/<strong>make</strong> build procedure which people
probably are most familiar with.
</p><a name="Build-and-Install-Procedure_Building-With-configuremake-Directly"></a><h3>Building With configure/make Directly</h3><p>
(1)
</p><p>
Change directory into the top directory of the Erlang/OTP source tree.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ cd $ERL_TOP
</code></pre><p>
In order to compile Erlang code, a small Erlang bootstrap system has to be
built, or an Erlang/OTP system of the same release as the one being built
has to be provided in the <strong>$PATH</strong>. The Erlang/OTP for the target system will
be built using this Erlang system, together with the cross compilation tools
provided.
</p><p>
If you want to build using a compatible Erlang/OTP system in the <strong>$PATH</strong>,
jump to (3).
</p><a name="Build-and-Install-Procedure_Building-With-configuremake-Directly_Building-a-Bootstrap-System"></a><h3>Building a Bootstrap System</h3><p>
(2)
</p><pre><code class="">
$ ./configure --enable-bootstrap-only
$ make
</code></pre><p>
The <strong>--enable-bootstrap-only</strong> argument to <strong>configure</strong> isn't strictly necessary,
but will speed things up. It will only run <strong>configure</strong> in applications
necessary for the bootstrap, and will disable a lot of things not needed by
the bootstrap system. If you run <strong>configure</strong> without <strong>--enable-boostrap-only</strong>
you also have to run make as <strong>make bootstrap</strong>; otherwise, the whole system will
be built.
</p><a name="Build-and-Install-Procedure_Building-With-configuremake-Directly_Cross-Building-the-System"></a><h3>Cross Building the System</h3><p>
(3)
</p><pre><code class="">
$ ./configure --host=&lt;HOST&gt; --build=&lt;BUILD&gt; [Other Config Args]
$ make
</code></pre><p>
<strong>&lt;HOST&gt;</strong> is the host/target system that you build for. It does not have to be
a full <strong>CPU-VENDOR-OS</strong> triplet, but can be. The full <strong>CPU-VENDOR-OS</strong> triplet
will be created by executing <strong>$ERL_TOP/erts/autoconf/config.sub &lt;HOST&gt;</strong>. If
<strong>config.sub</strong> fails, you need to be more specific.
</p><p>
<strong>&lt;BUILD&gt;</strong> should equal the <strong>CPU-VENDOR-OS</strong> triplet of the system that you
build on. If you execute <strong>$ERL_TOP/erts/autoconf/config.guess</strong>, it will in
most cases print the triplet you want to use for this.
</p><p>
Pass the cross compilation variables as command line arguments to <strong>configure</strong>
using a <strong>&lt;VARIABLE&gt;=&lt;VALUE&gt;</strong> syntax.
</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>
You can <em>not</em> pass a configuration file using the <strong>--xcomp-conf</strong>
argument when you invoke <strong>configure</strong> directly. The <strong>--xcomp-conf</strong> argument
can only be passed to <strong>otp_build configure</strong>.
</p></div><p>
<strong>make</strong> will verify that the Erlang/OTP system used when building is of the
same release as the system being built, and will fail if this is not the case.
It is possible, however not recommended, to force the cross compilation even
though the wrong Erlang/OTP system is used. This by invoking <strong>make</strong> like this:
<strong>make ERL_XCOMP_FORCE_DIFFERENT_OTP=yes</strong>.
</p><div class="alert alert-warning"><h4 class="alert-heading">Warning</h4><p>
Invoking <strong>make ERL_XCOMP_FORCE_DIFFERENT_OTP=yes</strong> might fail,
silently produce suboptimal code, or silently produce erroneous code.
</p></div><a name="Build-and-Install-Procedure_Building-With-configuremake-Directly_Installing"></a><h3>Installing</h3><p>
You can either install using the installation paths determined by <strong>configure</strong>
(4), or install manually using (5).

(4)
</p><pre><code class="">
$ make install DESTDIR=&lt;TEMPORARY_PREFIX&gt;
</code></pre><p>
<strong>make install</strong> will install at a location specified when doing <strong>configure</strong>.
<strong>configure</strong> arguments specifying where the installation should reside are for
example: <strong>--prefix</strong>, <strong>--exec-prefix</strong>, <strong>--libdir</strong>, <strong>--bindir</strong>, etc. By default
it will install under <strong>/usr/local</strong>. You typically do not want to install your
cross build under <strong>/usr/local</strong> on your build machine. Using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/DESTDIR.html">DESTDIR</a>
will cause the installation paths to be prefixed by <strong>$DESTDIR</strong>. This makes it
possible to install and package the installation on the build machine without
having to place the installation in the same directory on the build machine as
it should be executed from on the target machine.
</p><p>
When <strong>make install</strong> has finished, change directory into <strong>$DESTDIR</strong>, package
the system, move it to the target machine, and unpack it. Note that the
installation will only be working on the target machine at the location
determined by <strong>configure</strong>.
</p><a name="Build-and-Install-Procedure_Building-With-configuremake-Directly_Installing_Installing-Manually"></a><h3>Installing Manually</h3><p>
(5)
</p><pre><code class="">
$ make release RELEASE_ROOT=&lt;RELEASE_DIR&gt;
</code></pre><p>
<strong>make release</strong> will copy what you have built for the target machine to
<strong>&lt;RELEASE_DIR&gt;</strong>. The <strong>Install</strong> script will not be run. The content of
<strong>&lt;RELEASE_DIR&gt;</strong> is what by default ends up in <strong>/usr/local/lib/erlang</strong>.
</p><p>
The <strong>Install</strong> script used when installing Erlang/OTP requires common Unix
tools such as <strong>sed</strong> to be present in your <strong>$PATH</strong>. If your target system
does not have such tools, you need to run the <strong>Install</strong> script on your
build machine before packaging Erlang/OTP. The <strong>Install</strong> script should
currently be invoked as follows in the directory where it resides
(the top directory):
</p><pre><code class="">
$ ./Install [-cross] [-minimal|-sasl] &lt;ERL_ROOT&gt;
</code></pre><p>
where:
</p><ul><li> <strong>-minimal</strong> Creates an installation that starts up a minimal amount of applications, i.e., only <strong>kernel</strong> and <strong>stdlib</strong> are started. The minimal system is normally enough, and is what <strong>make install</strong> uses. </li><li> <strong>-sasl</strong> Creates an installation that also starts up the <strong>sasl</strong> application. </li><li> <strong>-cross</strong> For cross compilation. Informs the install script that it is run on the build machine. </li><li> <strong>&lt;ERL_ROOT&gt;</strong> - The absolute path to the Erlang installation to use at run time. This is often the same as the current working directory, but does not have to be. It can follow any other path through the file system to the same directory. </li></ul><p>
If neither <strong>-minimal</strong>, nor <strong>-sasl</strong> is passed as argument you will be
prompted.
</p><p>
You can now either do:
</p><p>
(6)
</p><ul><li> <p>Decide where the installation should be located on the target machine,
run the <strong>Install</strong> script on the build machine, and package the installed
installation. The installation just need to be unpacked at the right
location on the target machine:
</p> <pre><code class="">
$ cd &lt;RELEASE_DIR&gt;
$ ./Install -cross [-minimal|-sasl] &lt;ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DIR_ON_TARGET&gt;
</code></pre> </li></ul><p>
or:
</p><p>
(7)
</p><ul><li> <p>Package the installation in <strong>&lt;RELEASE_DIR&gt;</strong>, place it wherever you want
on your target machine, and run the <strong>Install</strong> script on your target
machine:
</p> <pre><code class="">
$ cd &lt;ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DIR_ON_TARGET&gt;
$ ./Install [-minimal|-sasl] &lt;ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DIR_ON_TARGET&gt;
</code></pre> </li></ul><a name="Build-and-Install-Procedure_Building-With-the-otpbuild-Script"></a><h3>Building With the otp_build Script</h3><p>
(8)
</p><pre><code class="">
$ cd $ERL_TOP
</code></pre><p>
(9)
</p><pre><code class="">
$ ./otp_build configure --xcomp-conf=&lt;FILE&gt; [Other Config Args]
</code></pre><p>
alternatively:
</p><pre><code class="">
$ ./otp_build configure --host=&lt;HOST&gt; --build=&lt;BUILD&gt; [Other Config Args]
</code></pre><p>
If you have your cross compilation configuration in a file, pass it using the
<strong>--xcomp-conf=&lt;FILE&gt;</strong> command line argument. If not, pass <strong>--host=&lt;HOST&gt;</strong>,
<strong>--build=&lt;BUILD&gt;</strong>, and the configuration variables using a <strong>&lt;VARIABLE&gt;=&lt;VALUE&gt;</strong>
syntax on the command line  (same as in (3)). Note that <strong>&lt;HOST&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;BUILD&gt;</strong>
have to be passed one way or the other; either by using <strong>erl_xcomp_host=&lt;HOST&gt;</strong>
and <strong>erl_xcomp_build=&lt;BUILD&gt;</strong> in the configuration file, or by using the
<strong>--host=&lt;HOST&gt;</strong>, and <strong>--build=&lt;BUILD&gt;</strong> command line arguments.
</p><p>
<strong>otp_build configure</strong> will configure both for the boostrap system on the
build machine and the cross host system.
</p><p>
(10)
</p><pre><code class="">
$ ./otp_build boot -a
</code></pre><p>
<strong>otp_build boot -a</strong> will first build a bootstrap system for the build machine
and then do the cross build of the system.
</p><p>
(11)
</p><pre><code class="">
$ ./otp_build release -a &lt;RELEASE_DIR&gt;
</code></pre><p>
<strong>otp_build release -a</strong> will do the same as (5), and you will after this have
to do a manual install either by doing (6), or (7).
</p><a name="Building-and-Installing-the-Documentation"></a><h3>Building and Installing the Documentation</h3><p>
After the system has been cross built you can build and install the
documentation the same way as after a native build of the system. See the
<a href="./INSTALL#How-to-Build-and-Install-ErlangOTP_How-to-Build-the-Documentation">How to Build the Documentation</a> section in the <a href="INSTALL">$ERL_TOP/HOWTO/INSTALL.md</a>
document for information on how to build the documentation.
</p><a name="Testing-the-cross-compiled-system"></a><h3>Testing the cross compiled system</h3><p>
Some of the tests that come with erlang use native code to test. This means
that when cross compiling erlang you also have to cross compile test suites
in order to run tests on the target host. To do this you first have to release
the tests as usual.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ make release_tests
</code></pre><p>
or
</p><pre><code class="">
$ ./otp_build tests
</code></pre><p>
The tests will be released into <strong>$ERL_TOP/release/tests</strong>. After releasing the
tests you have to install the tests on the build machine. You supply the same
xcomp file as to <strong>./otp_build</strong> in (9).
</p><pre><code class="">
$ cd $ERL_TOP/release/tests/test_server/
$ $ERL_TOP/bootstrap/bin/erl -eval 'ts:install([{xcomp,"&lt;FILE&gt;"}])' -s ts compile_testcases -s init stop
</code></pre><p>
You should get a lot of printouts as the testcases are compiled. Once done you
should copy the entire <strong>$ERL_TOP/release/tests</strong> folder to the cross host system.
</p><p>
Then go to the cross host system and setup the erlang installed in (4) or (5)
to be in your <strong>$PATH</strong>. Then go to what previously was
<strong>$ERL_TOP/release/tests/test_server</strong> and issue the following command.
</p><pre><code class="">
$ erl -s ts install -s ts run all_tests -s init stop
</code></pre><p>
The configure should be skipped and all tests should hopefully pass. For more
details about how to use ts run <strong>erl -s ts help -s init stop</strong>

Note that you cannot define arbitrary variables in a cross compilation
configuration file. Only the ones listed below will be guaranteed to be
visible throughout the whole execution of all <strong>configure</strong> scripts. Other
variables needs to be defined as arguments to <strong>configure</strong> or exported in
the environment.
</p><a name="Currently-Used-Configuration-Variables_Variables-for-otpbuild-Only"></a><h3>Variables for otp_build Only</h3><p>
Variables in this section are only used, when configuring Erlang/OTP for

</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>
These variables currently have <em>no</em> effect if you configure using
the <strong>configure</strong> script directly.
</p></div><ul><li> <p><strong>erl_xcomp_build</strong> - The build system used. This value will be passed as
<strong>--build=$erl_xcomp_build</strong> argument to the <strong>configure</strong> script. It does
not have to be a full <strong>CPU-VENDOR-OS</strong> triplet, but can be. The full
<strong>CPU-VENDOR-OS</strong> triplet will be created by
<strong>$ERL_TOP/erts/autoconf/config.sub $erl_xcomp_build</strong>. If set to <strong>guess</strong>,
the build system will be guessed using
<strong>$ERL_TOP/erts/autoconf/config.guess</strong>.
</p> </li><li> <p><strong>erl_xcomp_host</strong> - Cross host/target system to build for. This value will
be passed as <strong>--host=$erl_xcomp_host</strong> argument to the <strong>configure</strong> script.
It does not have to be a full <strong>CPU-VENDOR-OS</strong> triplet, but can be. The

Some of these values will override results of tests performed
by <strong>configure</strong>, and some will not be used until <strong>configure</strong> is sure that
it cannot figure the result out.
</p></div><p>
The <strong>configure</strong> script will issue a warning when a default value is used.
When a variable has been set, no warning will be issued.
</p><ul><li> <p><strong>erl_xcomp_after_morecore_hook</strong> - <strong>yes|no</strong>. Defaults to <strong>no</strong>. If <strong>yes</strong>,
the target system must have a working <strong>__after_morecore_hook</strong> that can be
used for tracking used <strong>malloc()</strong> implementations core memory usage.
This is currently only used by unsupported features.
</p> </li><li> <p><strong>erl_xcomp_bigendian</strong> - <strong>yes|no</strong>. No default. If <strong>yes</strong>, the target system
must be big endian. If <strong>no</strong>, little endian. This can often be
automatically detected, but not always. If not automatically detected,
<strong>configure</strong> will fail unless this variable is set. Since no default
value is used, <strong>configure</strong> will try to figure this out automatically.
</p> </li><li> <p><strong>erl_xcomp_double_middle</strong> - <strong>yes|no</strong>. Defaults to <strong>no</strong>. 
If <strong>yes</strong>, the target system must have doubles in "middle-endian" format. If
<strong>no</strong>, it has "regular" endianness. 	
</p> </li><li> <p><strong>erl_xcomp_clock_gettime_cpu_time</strong> - <strong>yes|no</strong>. Defaults to <strong>no</strong>. If <strong>yes</strong>,
the target system must have a working <strong>clock_gettime()</strong> implementation
that can be used for retrieving process CPU time.
</p> </li><li> <p><strong>erl_xcomp_getaddrinfo</strong> - <strong>yes|no</strong>. Defaults to <strong>no</strong>. If <strong>yes</strong>, the target
system must have a working <strong>getaddrinfo()</strong> implementation that can
handle both IPv4 and IPv6.
</p> </li><li> <p><strong>erl_xcomp_gethrvtime_procfs_ioctl</strong> - <strong>yes|no</strong>. Defaults to <strong>no</strong>. If <strong>yes</strong>,
the target system must have a working <strong>gethrvtime()</strong> implementation and
is used with procfs <strong>ioctl()</strong>.
</p> </li><li> <p><strong>erl_xcomp_dlsym_brk_wrappers</strong> - <strong>yes|no</strong>. Defaults to <strong>no</strong>. If <strong>yes</strong>, the
target system must have a working <strong>dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, &lt;S&gt;)</strong> implementation
that can be used on <strong>brk</strong> and <strong>sbrk</strong> symbols used by the <strong>malloc()</strong>
implementation in use, and by this track the <strong>malloc()</strong> implementations
core memory usage. This is currently only used by unsupported features.
</p> </li><li> <p><strong>erl_xcomp_kqueue</strong> - <strong>yes|no</strong>. Defaults to <strong>no</strong>. If <strong>yes</strong>, the target
system must have a working <strong>kqueue()</strong> implementation that returns a file
descriptor which can be used by <strong>poll()</strong> and/or <strong>select()</strong>. If <strong>no</strong> and
the target system has not got <strong>epoll()</strong> or <strong>/dev/poll</strong>, the kernel-poll
feature will be disabled.
</p> </li><li> <p><strong>erl_xcomp_linux_clock_gettime_correction</strong> - <strong>yes|no</strong>. Defaults to <strong>yes</strong> on
Linux; otherwise, <strong>no</strong>. If <strong>yes</strong>, <strong>clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, _)</strong> on
the target system must work. This variable is recommended to be set to
<strong>no</strong> on Linux systems with kernel versions less than 2.6.
</p> </li><li> <p><strong>erl_xcomp_linux_nptl</strong> - <strong>yes|no</strong>. Defaults to <strong>yes</strong> on Linux; otherwise,
<strong>no</strong>. If <strong>yes</strong>, the target system must have NPTL (Native POSIX Thread
Library). Older Linux systems have LinuxThreads instead of NPTL (Linux
kernel versions typically less than 2.6).
</p> </li><li> <p><strong>erl_xcomp_linux_usable_sigaltstack</strong> - <strong>yes|no</strong>. Defaults to <strong>yes</strong> on Linux;
otherwise, <strong>no</strong>. If <strong>yes</strong>, <strong>sigaltstack()</strong> must be usable on the target
system. <strong>sigaltstack()</strong> on Linux kernel versions less than 2.4 are
broken.
</p> </li><li> <p><strong>erl_xcomp_linux_usable_sigusrx</strong> - <strong>yes|no</strong>. Defaults to <strong>yes</strong>. If <strong>yes</strong>,
the <strong>SIGUSR1</strong> and <strong>SIGUSR2</strong> signals must be usable by the ERTS. Old
LinuxThreads thread libraries (Linux kernel versions typically less than
2.2) used these signals and made them unusable by the ERTS.
</p> </li><li> <p><strong>erl_xcomp_poll</strong> - <strong>yes|no</strong>. Defaults to <strong>no</strong> on Darwin/MacOSX; otherwise,

This section describes how to build the Erlang emulator and the OTP 
libraries on Windows. Note that the Windows binary releases are still 
a preferred alternative if one does not have Microsoftâs development 
tools and/or donât want to install Cygwin, MSYS or MSYS2.
</p><p>
The instructions apply to versions of Windows supporting the Cygwin 
emulated gnuish environment or the MSYS or MSYS2 ditto. Weâve built on 
the following platforms: Windows 2012, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10. 
Itâs probably possible to build on older platforms too, but you might 
not be able to install the appropriate Microsoft SDK, Visual Studio or 
OpenSSL, in which case you will need to go back to earlier compilers etc.<br/>
</p><p>
The procedure described uses either Cygwin, MSYS or MSYS2 as a build 
environment. You run the bash shell in Cygwin/MSYS/MSYS2 and use the gnu 
make/configure/autoconf etc to do the build. The emulator C-source code 
is, however, mostly compiled with Microsoft Visual C++â¢, producing a 
native Windows binary. This is the same procedure as we use to build the 
pre-built binaries. Why we use VC++ and not gcc is explained further in 
the FAQ section. 
</p><p>
If you are not familiar with Cygwin, MSYS, MSYS2 or a Unix environment, 
youâll probably need to read up a bit on how that works. There are plenty of 
documentation about this online.
</p><p>
These instructions apply for both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows. Note that even 
if you build a 64-bit version of Erlang, most of the directories and files 
involved are still named win32. Some occurances of the name win64 are 
however present. The installation file for a 64-bit Windows version of 
Erlang, for example, is <strong>otp_win64_22.exe</strong>.
</p><p>
If you feel comfortable with the environment and build
system, and have all the necessary tools, you have a great opportunity
to make the Erlang/OTP distribution for Windows better. Please submit
any suggestions to our <a href="http://bugs.erlang.org">JIRA</a> and patches to our <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp">git project</a> to let
them find their way into the next version of Erlang. If making changes
to the build system (like makefiles etc) please bear in mind that the
same makefiles are used on Unix/VxWorks, so that your changes
don't break other platforms. That of course goes for C-code too; system
specific code resides in the <strong>$ERL_TOP/erts/emulator/sys/win32</strong> and
<strong>$ERL_TOP/erts/etc/win32</strong> directories mostly. The
<strong>$ERL_TOP/erts/emulator/beam</strong> directory is for common code.
</p><p>
We've used this build procedure for a couple of
releases, and it has worked fine for us. Still, there might be all
sorts of troubles on different machines and with different
setups. We'll try to give hints wherever we've encountered difficulties,
but please share your experiences by using the <a href="http://www.erlang.org/static/doc/mailinglist.html">erlang-questions</a>
mailing list. We cannot, of course, help everyone with all
their issues, so please try to solve such issues and submit
solutions/workarounds.
</p><p>
Lets go then! Weâll start with a short version of the setup procedure, 
followed by some FAQ, and then weâll go into more details of the setup. 
</p><a name="Short-Version"></a><h3>Short Version</h3><p>
In the following sections, we've described as much as we could about the 
installation of the tools needed. Once the tools are installed, building 
is quite easy. We have also tried to make these instructions understandable 
for people with limited Unix experience. Cygwin/MSYS/MSYS2 is a whole new 
environment to some Windows users, why careful explanation of environment 
variables etc seemed to be in place. 
</p><p>
This is the short story though, for the experienced and impatient:
</p><ul><li> <p>Get and install complete Cygwin (latest), complete MinGW with MSYS or 
complete MSYS2
</p> <ul><li> <p>Install Visual Studio 12.0 (2013)
</p> </li><li> <p>Install Microsofts Windows SDK 8.1 
</p> </li><li> <p>Get and install Sun's JDK 1.6.0 or later
</p> </li><li> <p>Get and install NSIS 2.01 or later (up to 2.46 tried and working)
</p> </li><li> <p>Get, build and install OpenSSL 0.9.8r or later (up to 1.0.2d
tried &amp; working) with static libs.
</p> </li><li> <p>Get the Erlang source distribution (from
<a href="http://www.erlang.org/download.html">http://www.erlang.org/download.html</a>) and unpack with 
Cygwin's/MSYS's/MSYS2's <strong>tar</strong>.
</p> </li><li> <p>Set <strong>ERL_TOP</strong> to where you unpacked the source distribution
</p> </li><li> <p><strong>$ cd $ERL_TOP</strong>
</p> </li><li> <p>Modify PATH and other environment variables so that all these tools
are runnable from a bash shell. Still standing in <strong>$ERL_TOP</strong>, issue
the following commands (for 32-bit Windows, remove the x64 from the 
first row and change <strong>otp_win64_22</strong> to <strong>otp_win32_22</strong> on
the last row):
</p> <pre><code class="">
$ eval `./otp_build env_win32 x64`
$ ./otp_build autoconf
$ ./otp_build configure
$ ./otp_build boot -a
$ ./otp_build release -a
$ ./otp_build installer_win32
$ release/win32/otp_win64_22 /S
</code></pre> </li></ul> <p>Voila! <strong>Start-&gt;Programs-&gt;Erlang OTP 22-&gt;Erlang</strong> starts the Erlang
Windows shell.
</p> </li></ul><a name="Frequently-Asked-Questions"></a><h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><ul><li> <p>Q: So, now I can build Erlang using GCC on Windows?
</p> <p>A: No, unfortunately not. You'll need Microsoft's Visual C++
still. A Bourne-shell script (cc.sh) wraps the Visual C++ compiler
and runs it from within the Cygwin environment. All other tools
needed to build Erlang are free-ware/open source, but not the C
compiler. The Windows SDK is however enough to build Erlang, you
do not need to buy Visual C++, just download the SDK (SDK version
8.1 == Visual studio 2013).
</p> </li><li> <p>Q: Why haven't you got rid of VC++ then, you ******?
</p> <p>A: Well, partly because it's a good compiler - really! Actually it's
been possible in late R11-releases to build using mingw instead of
visual C++ (you might see the remnants of that in some scripts and
directories). Unfortunately the development of the SMP version for
Windows broke the mingw build and we chose to focus on the VC++ build
as the performance has been much better in the VC++ versions. The
mingw build will possibly be back, but as long as VC++ gives better
performance, the commercial build will be a VC++ one.
</p> </li><li> <p>Q: OK, you need VC++, but now you've started to demand a quite recent
(and expensive) version of Visual Studio. Why?
</p> <p>A: Well, it's not expensive, it's free (as in free beer). Just
download and install the latest Windows SDK from Microsoft and all
the tools you need are there. The included debugger (WinDbg) is
also quite usable. That's what I used when porting Erlang to 64bit
Windows. Another reason to use later Microsoft compilers is 
DLL compatibility. DLL's using a new version of the standard
library might not load if the VM is compiled with an old VC++
version. So we should aim to use the latest freely available SDK
and compiler.
</p> </li><li> <p>Q: Can/will I build a Cygwin binary with the procedure you describe?
</p> <p>A: No, the result will be a pure Windows binary, and as far as I know,
it's not possible to make a Cygwin binary yet. That is of course
something desirable, but there are still some problems with the
dynamic linking (dynamic Erlang driver loading) as well as the TCP/IP
emulation in Cygwin, which, I'm sure of, will improve, but still has
some problems. Fixing those problems might be easy or might be hard.
I suggest you try yourself and share your experience. No one would be
happier if a simple <strong>./configure &amp;&amp; make</strong> would produce a fully fledged
Cygwin binary. 
</p> </li><li> <p>Q: Hah, I saw you, you used GCC even though you said you didn't!
</p> <p>A: OK, I admit, one of the files is compiled using Cygwin's or
MinGW's GCC and the resulting object code is then converted to MS
VC++ compatible coff using a small C hack. It's because that
particular file, <strong>beam_emu.c</strong> benefits immensely from being able
to use the GCC labels-as-values extension, which boosts emulator
performance by up to 50%. That does unfortunately not (yet) mean
that all of OTP could be compiled using GCC. That particular
source code does not do anything system specific and actually is
adopted to the fact that GCC is used to compile it on Windows.
</p> </li><li> <p>Q: So now there's a MS VC++ project file somewhere and I can build OTP
using the nifty VC++ GUI?
</p> <p>A: No, never. The hassle of keeping the project files up to date and
do all the steps that constitute an OTP build from within the VC++ GUI
is simply not worth it, maybe even impossible. A VC++ project
file for Erlang/OTP will never happen.
</p> </li><li> <p>Q: So how does it all work then?
</p> <p>A: Cygwin, MSYS or MSYS2 is the environment, which closely resembles the
environment found on any Unix machine. It's almost like you had a
virtual Unix machine inside Windows. Configure, given certain
parameters, then creates makefiles that are used by the
environment's gnu-make to built the system. Most of the actual
compilers etc are not, however, Cygwin/MSYS/MSYS2 tools, so we've written
a couple of wrappers (Bourne-shell scripts), which reside in
<strong>$ERL_TOP/etc/win32/cygwin_tools</strong> and
<strong>$ERL_TOP/etc/win32/msys_tools</strong>. They all do conversion of
parameters and switches common in the Unix environment to fit the
native Windows tools. Most notable is of course the paths, which
in Cygwin/MSYS/MSYS2 are Unix-like paths with "forward slashes" (/) and
no drive letters. The Cygwin specific command <strong>cygpath</strong> is used
for most of the path conversions in a Cygwin environment. Other
tools are used (when needed) in the corresponding MSYS and MSYS2
environment. Luckily most compilers accept forward slashes instead
of backslashes as path separators, but one still have to get the drive
letters etc right, though. The wrapper scripts are not general in
the sense that, for example, cc.sh would understand and translate
every possible gcc option and pass correct options to
cl.exe. The principle is that the scripts are powerful enough to
allow building of Erlang/OTP, no more, no less. They might need
extensions to cope with changes during the development of Erlang, and
that's one of the reasons we made them into shell-scripts and not
Perl-scripts. We believe they are easier to understand and change
that way.
</p> <p>In <strong>$ERL_TOP</strong>, there is a script called <strong>otp_build</strong>. That script handles
the hassle of giving all the right parameters to <strong>configure</strong>/<strong>make</strong> and
also helps you set up the correct environment variables to work with
the Erlang source under Cygwin/MSYS/MSYS2.
</p> </li><li> <p>Q: You use and need Cygwin, but then you haven't taken the time to
port Erlang to the Cygwin environment but instead focus on your
commercial release, is that really ethical?
</p> <p>A: No, not really, but see this as a step in the right direction. 
</p> </li><li> <p>Q: Can I build something that looks exactly as the commercial release?
</p> <p>A: Yes, we use the exact same build procedure.
</p> </li><li> <p>Q: Which version of Cygwin/MSYS/MSYS2 and other tools do you use then?
</p> <p>A: For Cygwin, MSYS and MSYS2 alike, we try to use the latest releases
available when building. What versions you use shouldn't really
matter. We try to include workarounds for the bugs we've found in
different Cygwin/MSYS/MSYS2 releases. Please help us add workarounds
for new Cygwin/MSYS/MSYS2-related bugs as soon as you encounter
them. Also please do submit bug reports to the appropriate Cygwin, MSYS
and/or MSYS2 developers. The GCC we used for 22 was version
4.8.1 (MinGW 32bit) and 4.8.5 (MSYS2 64bit). We used  VC++ 12.0 
(i.e. Visual studio 2013), Sun's JDK 1.6.0_45 (32bit) and Sun's
JDK 1.7.0_1 (64bit), NSIS 2.46, and Win32 OpenSSL 1.0.2d. Please
read the next section for details on what you need.
</p> </li><li> <p>Q: Can you help me setup X in Cygwin/MSYS/MSYS2?
</p> <p>A: No, unfortunately we haven't got time to help with Cygwin/MSYS/MSYS2 
related user problems, please read related websites, newsgroups and
mailing lists.
</p> </li></ul><a name="Tools-you-Need-and-Their-Environment"></a><h3>Tools you Need and Their Environment</h3><p>
You need some tools to be able to build Erlang/OTP on Windows. Most
notably you'll need Cygwin, MSYS or MSYS2, Visual Studio and Microsofts 
Windows SDK, but you might also want a Java compiler, the NSIS install 
system and OpenSSL. Well, here's some information about the different 
tools:
</p><ul><li> <p>Cygwin, the very latest is usually best. Get all the development
tools and of course all the basic ditto. Make sure to get jar and 
also make sure <em>not</em> to install a Cygwin'ish Java, since the Cygwin 
jar command is used but Sun's Java compiler and virtual machine.
</p> <p>If you are going to build a 64bit Windows version, you should make
sure to get MinGW's 64bit gcc installed with Cygwin. It's in one of
the development packages.
</p> <p>URL: <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">http://www.cygwin.com</a>
</p> <p>Get the installer from the website and use it to install
Cygwin. Be sure to have fair privileges. If you're on an NT domain you
should consider running <strong>mkpasswd -d</strong> and <strong>mkgroup -d</strong> after the
installation to get the user databases correct. See their respective
manual pages.
</p> <p>When you start your first bash shell, you will get an awful prompt. You
might also have a <strong>PATH</strong> environment variable that contains backslashes
and such. Edit <strong>$HOME/.profile</strong> and <strong>$HOME/.bashrc</strong> to set fair prompts
and a correct PATH. Also do an <strong>export SHELL</strong> in <strong>.profile</strong>. For some
non-obvious reason the environment variable <strong>$SHELL</strong> is not exported in
bash. Also note that <strong>.profile</strong> is run at login time and <strong>.bashrc</strong> when
sub shells are created. You'll need to explicitly source <strong>.bashrc</strong> from
<strong>.profile</strong> if you want the commands there to be run at login time (like
setting up aliases, shell functions and the like). You can for example 
do like this at the end of <strong>.profile</strong>:
</p> <pre><code class="">
ENV=$HOME/.bashrc
export ENV
. $ENV
</code></pre> <p>You might also want to setup X-windows (XFree86). That might be as easy 
as running startx from the command prompt and it might be much harder. 
Use Google to find help.
</p> <p>If you don't use X-windows, you might want to setup the Windows
console window by selecting properties in the console system menu
(upper left corner of the window, the Cygwin icon in the title
bar). Especially setting a larger screen buffer size (lines) is useful
as it gets you a scrollbar so you can see whatever error messages
that might appear.
</p> <p>There are a few other shells available, but in all examples below we assume
that you use bash.
</p> </li><li> <p>Alternatively you download MinGW and MSYS. You'll find the latest
installer at:
</p> <p>URL: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-inst/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-inst/</a>
</p> <p>Make sure to install the basic dev tools, but avoid the MinGW autoconf and
install the msys one instead.<br/>
</p> <p>To be able to build the 64bit VM, you will also need the 64bit
MinGW compiler from:
</p> <p>URL: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/latest/download?source=files">http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/latest/download?source=files</a>
</p> <p>We've tried up to 1.0, but the latest version should do. Make sure you 
download the <strong>mingw-w64-bin_i686-mingw_&lt;something&gt;.zip</strong>, not a linux
version. You unzip the package on top of your MinGW installation
(<strong>c:\MinGW</strong>) and that's it.
</p> </li><li> <p>A third alternative is to download and install MSYS2 from:
</p> <p>URL: <a href="https://msys2.github.io/">https://msys2.github.io/</a>
</p> <p>When you've followed the instructions there, you also need to install 
these packages: autoconf, make, perl, and tar. You do so by running 
the following in the msys console:
</p> <pre><code class="">
pacman -S msys/autoconf msys/make msys/perl msys/tar 
</code></pre> <p>You also need a gcc. If you installed the 64 bit MSYS2 you run:
</p> <pre><code class="">
mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc
</code></pre> <p>And for 32 bit MSYS2:
</p> <pre><code class="">
pacman -S mingw32/mingw-w64-i686-gcc
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-editrights
</code></pre> </li><li> <p>Visual Studio 2013 (Visual Studio 12.0). Download and run the web 
installer from: 
</p> <pre><code class="">
https://www.visualstudio.com/
</code></pre> </li><li> <p>Microsofts Windows SDK version 8.1 (corresponding to VC++ 12.0 and
Visual Studio 2013). You'll find it here:
</p> <p>URL: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/bg162891.aspx">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/bg162891.aspx</a>
</p> </li><li> <p>To help setup the environment, there is a bat file, 
<strong>%PROGRAMFILES%\Mirosoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat</strong>, 
that set's the appropriate
environment for a Windows command prompt. This is not appropriate
for bash, so you'll need to convert it to bash-style environments
by editing your <strong>.bash_profile</strong>. In my case, where the SDK is
installed in the default directory and <strong>%PROGRAMFILES%</strong> is
<strong>C:\Program Files</strong>, the commands for setting up a 32bit build
environment (on a 64bit or 32bit machine) look like this (in Cygwin):

</p> <p>Make a simple hello world and try to compile it with the <strong>cl</strong> 
command from within bash. If that does not work, your environment 
needs fixing. Remember, there should be
no backslashes in your path environment variable in Cygwin bash,
but LIB and INCLUDE should contain Windows style paths with
semicolon, drive letters and backslashes.
</p> </li><li> <p>Sun's Java JDK 1.6.0 or later. Our Java code (jinterface, ic) is
written for JDK 1.6.0. Get it for Windows and install it, the JRE is
not enough. If you don't care about Java, you can skip this step. The
result will be that jinterface is not built.
</p> <p>URL: <a href="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</a>
</p> <p>Add javac <em>LAST</em> to your path environment in bash, in my case this means:
</p> <pre><code class="">
`PATH="$PATH:/cygdrive/c/Program Files/Java/jdk1.7.0_02/bin"`
</code></pre> <p>No <strong>CLASSPATH</strong> or anything is needed. Type <strong>javac</strong> in the bash prompt
and you should get a list of available Java options. Make sure, e.g by
typing <strong>type java</strong>, that you use the Java you installed. Note however that
Cygwin's/MinGW's/MSYS2's <strong>jar.exe</strong> is used. That's why the JDK bin-directory should be
added last in the <strong>PATH</strong>.
</p> </li><li> <p>Nullsoft NSIS installer system. You need this to build the self
installing package. It's a free open source installer that's much
nicer to use than the commercial Wise and Install shield
installers. This is the installer we use for commercial releases as
well.
</p> <p>URL: <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/download">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/download</a>
</p> <p>Install the lot, especially the modern user interface components, as
it's definitely needed. Put <strong>makensis</strong> in your path, in my case:

download and install, available here:
</p> <p>URL: <a href="http://openssl.org/community/binaries.html">http://openssl.org/community/binaries.html</a>
</p> <p>We would recommend using 1.0.2d. 
</p> </li><li> <p>Building with wxWidgets. Download wxWidgets-3.0.3 or higher.
</p> <p>Install or unpack it to the pgm folder:
Cygwin: 
<strong>DRIVE:/PATH/cygwin/opt/local/pgm</strong>
MSYS:
<strong>DRIVE:/PATH/MinGW/msys/1.0/opt/local/pgm</strong>
MSYS2:
<strong>DRIVE:/PATH/msys&lt;32/64&gt;/opt/local/pgm</strong>
</p> <p>If the <strong>wxUSE_POSTSCRIPT</strong> isn't enabled in  <strong>&lt;path\to\pgm&gt;\wxMSW-3.0.3\include\wx\msw\setup.h</strong>,
enable it.
</p> <p>build: From a command prompt with the VC tools available (See the
instructions for OpenSSL build above for help on starting the
proper command prompt in RELEASE mode):
</p> <pre><code class="">
C:\...\&gt; cd &lt;path\to\pgm&gt;\wxMSW-3.0.3\build\msw
C:\...\&gt; nmake BUILD=release SHARED=0 DIR_SUFFIX_CPU= -f makefile.vc
</code></pre> <p>Or - if building a 64bit version:
</p> <pre><code class="">
C:\...\&gt; cd &lt;path\to\pgm&gt;\wxMSW-3.0.3\build\msw
C:\...\&gt; nmake TARGET_CPU=amd64 BUILD=release SHARED=0 DIR_SUFFIX_CPU= -f makefile.vc
</code></pre> </li><li> <p>Get the Erlang source distribution (from <a href="http://www.erlang.org/download.html">http://www.erlang.org/download.html</a>).
The same as for Unix platforms. Preferably use tar from within Cygwin, MSYS or MSYS2 to
unpack the source tar.gz (<strong>tar zxf otp_src_22.tar.gz</strong>).
</p> <p>Set the environment <strong>ERL_TOP</strong> to point to the root directory of the
source distribution. Let's say I stood in <strong>$HOME/src</strong> and unpacked
<strong>otp_src_22.tar.gz</strong>, I then add the following to <strong>.profile</strong>:
</p> <pre><code class="">
ERL_TOP=$HOME/src/otp_src_22
export $ERL_TOP
</code></pre> </li></ul><a name="The-Shell-Environment"></a><h3>The Shell Environment</h3><p>
So, if you have followed the instructions above, when you start a bash
shell, you should have an INCLUDE environment with a Windows style
path, a LIB environment variable also in Windows style, and finally a
PATH that let's you reach cl, makensis, javac etc from the
command prompt (use <strong>which cl</strong> etc to verify from bash).
</p><p>
You should also have an <strong>ERL_TOP</strong> environment variable that is <em>Cygwin style</em>, and points to a directory containing, among other files, the
script <strong>otp_build</strong>.
</p><p>
A final massage of the environment is needed, and that is done by
the script <strong>$ERL_TOP/otp_build</strong>. Start bash and do the following, note
the "back-ticks" (`), can be quite hard to get on some keyboards, but
pressing the back-tick key followed by the space bar might do it...
</p><pre><code class="">
$ cd $ERL_TOP
$ eval `./otp_build env_win32`
</code></pre><p>
If you're unable to produce back-ticks on your keyboard, you can use
the ksh variant:
</p><pre><code class="">
$ cd $ERL_TOP
$ eval $(./otp_build env_win32)
</code></pre><p>
If you are building a 64 bit version, you supply <strong>otp_build</strong> with an architecture parameter:
</p><pre><code class="">
$ cd $ERL_TOP
$ eval `./otp_build env_win32 x64`
</code></pre><p>
This should do the final touch to the environment and building should
be easy after this. You could run <strong>./otp_build env_win32</strong> without
<strong>eval</strong> just to see what it does, and to see that the environment it
sets seems OK. The path is cleaned of spaces if possible (using DOS
style short names instead), the variables <strong>OVERRIDE_TARGET</strong>, <strong>CC</strong>, <strong>CXX</strong>,
<strong>AR</strong> and <strong>RANLIB</strong> are set to their respective wrappers and the directories
<strong>$ERL_TOP/erts/etc/win32/&lt;cygwin/msys&gt;_tools/vc</strong> and
<strong>$ERL_TOP/erts/etc/win32/&lt;cygwin/msys&gt;_tool</strong> are added first in the PATH.
</p><p>
Now you can check which erlc you have by writing <strong>type erlc</strong> in your shell. 
It should reside in <strong>$ERL_TOP/erts/etc/win32/cygwin_tools</strong>
or <strong>$ERL_TOP/erts/etc/win32/msys_tools</strong>.
</p><a name="Building-and-Installing"></a><h3>Building and Installing</h3><p>
Building is easiest using the <strong>otp_build</strong> script: 
</p><pre><code class="">
$ ./otp_build autoconf # Ignore the warning blob about versions of autoconf
$ ./otp_build configure &lt;optional configure options&gt;
$ ./otp_build boot -a
$ ./otp_build release -a &lt;installation directory&gt;
$ ./otp_build installer_win32 &lt;installation directory&gt; # optional
</code></pre><p>
Now you will have a file called <strong>otp_win32_22.exe</strong> or <strong>otp_win64_22.exe</strong> 
in the <strong>&lt;installation directory&gt;</strong>, i.e. <strong>$ERL_TOP/release/win32</strong>.
</p><p>
Lets get into more detail:
</p><ul><li> <p><strong>$ ./otp_build autoconf</strong> - This step rebuilds the configure scripts
to work correctly in your environment. In an ideal world, this
would not be needed, but alas, we have encountered several
incompatibilities between our distributed configure scripts (generated
on a Linux platform) and the Cygwin/MSYS/MSYS2 environment over the
years. Running autoconf in Cygwin/MSYS/MSYS2 ensures that the configure 
scripts are generated in a compatible way and that they will work well
in the next step.
</p> </li><li> <p><strong>$ ./otp_build configure</strong> - This runs the newly generated configure
scripts with options making configure behave nicely. The target machine
type is plainly <strong>win32</strong>, so a lot of the configure-scripts recognize
this awkward target name and behave accordingly. The CC variable also
makes the compiler be <strong>cc.sh</strong>, which wraps MSVC++, so all configure
tests regarding the C compiler gets to run the right compiler. A lot of
the tests are not needed on Windows, but we thought it best to run the
whole configure anyway.
</p> </li><li> <p><strong>$ ./otp_build boot -a</strong> - This uses the bootstrap directory (shipped
with the source, <strong>$ERL_TOP/bootstrap</strong>) to build a complete OTP
system. When this is done you can run erl from within the source tree; 
just type <strong>$ERL_TOP/bin/erl</strong> and you whould have the prompt. 
</p> </li><li> <p><strong>$ ./otp_build release -a</strong> - Builds a commercial release tree from the
source tree. The default is to put it in <strong>$ERL_TOP/release/win32</strong>. You can
give any directory as parameter (Cygwin style), but it doesn't really
matter if you're going to build a self extracting installer too. 
</p> </li><li> <p><strong>$ ./otp_build installer_win32</strong> - Creates the self extracting installer executable. 
The executable <strong>otp_win32_22.exe</strong> or <strong>otp_win64_22.exe</strong> will be placed
in the top directory of the release created in the previous step. If
no release directory is specified, the release is expected to have
been built to <strong>$ERL_TOP/release/win32</strong>, which also will be the place
where the installer executable will be placed. If you specified some
other directory for the release (i.e. <strong>./otp_build release -a /tmp/erl_release</strong>), you're expected to give the same parameter here,
(i.e. <strong>./otp_build installer_win32 /tmp/erl_release</strong>). You need to have
a full NSIS installation and <strong>makensis.exe</strong> in your path for this to
work. Once you have created the installer, you can run it to
install Erlang/OTP in the regular way, just run the executable and
follow the steps in the installation wizard. To get all default settings
in the installation without any questions asked, you run the executable
with the parameter <strong>/S</strong> (capital S) like in:
</p> <pre><code class="">
$ cd $ERL_TOP
$ release/win32/otp_win32_22 /S
...
</code></pre> <p>or
</p> <pre><code class="">
$ cd $ERL_TOP
$ release/win32/otp_win64_22 /S
...
</code></pre> <p>and after a while Erlang/OTP-22 will have been installed in
<strong>C:\Program Files\erl10.3.4\</strong>, with shortcuts in the menu etc.
</p> </li></ul><a name="Development"></a><h3>Development</h3><p>
Once the system is built, you might want to change it. Having a test
release in some nice directory might be useful, but you can also run
Erlang from within the source tree. The target <strong>local_setup</strong>, makes
the program <strong>$ERL_TOP/bin/erl.exe</strong> usable and it also uses all the OTP
libraries in the source tree.
</p><p>
If you hack the emulator, you can build the emulator executable
by standing in <strong>$ERL_TOP/erts/emulator</strong> and do a simple
</p><pre><code class="">
$ make opt
</code></pre><p>
Note that you need to have run <strong>(cd $ERL_TOP &amp;&amp; eval `./otp_build env_win32`)</strong>
in the particular shell before building anything on Windows. After
doing a make opt you can test your result by running <strong>$ERL_TOP/bin/erl</strong>.
If you want to copy the result to a release directory (say
<strong>/tmp/erl_release</strong>), you do this (still in  <strong>$ERL_TOP/erts/emulator</strong>)
</p><pre><code class="">
$ make TESTROOT=/tmp/erl_release release
</code></pre><p>
That will copy the emulator executables.
</p><p>
To make a debug build of the emulator, you need to recompile both
<strong>beam.dll</strong> (the actual runtime system) and <strong>erlexec.dll</strong>. Do like this
</p><pre><code class="">
$ cd $ERL_TOP
$ rm bin/win32/erlexec.dll
$ cd erts/emulator
$ make debug
$ cd ../etc
$ make debug
</code></pre><p>
and sometimes
</p><pre><code class="">
$ cd $ERL_TOP
$ make local_setup
</code></pre><p>
So now when you run <strong>$ERL_TOP/erl.exe</strong>, you should have a debug compiled
emulator, which you will see if you do a:
</p><pre><code class="">
1&gt; erlang:system_info(system_version).
</code></pre><p>
in the erlang shell. If the returned string contains <strong>[debug]</strong>, you
got a debug compiled emulator.
</p><p>
To hack the erlang libraries, you simply do a <strong>make opt</strong> in the
specific "applications" directory, like:
</p><pre><code class="">
$ cd $ERL_TOP/lib/stdlib
$ make opt
</code></pre><p>
or even in the source directory...
</p><pre><code class="">
$ cd $ERL_TOP/lib/stdlib/src
$ make opt
</code></pre><p>
Note that you're expected to have a fresh Erlang in your path when
doing this, preferably the plain 22 you have built in the previous
steps. You could also add <strong>$ERL_TOP/bootstrap/bin</strong> to your <strong>PATH</strong> before
rebuilding specific libraries. That would give you a good enough
Erlang system to compile any OTP erlang code.  Setting up the path
correctly is a little bit tricky. You still need to have
<strong>$ERL_TOP/erts/etc/win32/cygwin_tools/vc</strong> and
<strong>$ERL_TOP/erts/etc/win32/cygwin_tools</strong> <em>before</em> the actual emulator
in the path. A typical setting of the path for using the bootstrap
compiler would be:
</p><pre><code class="">
$ export PATH=$ERL_TOP/erts/etc/win32/cygwin_tools/vc\
:$ERL_TOP/erts/etc/win32/cygwin_tools:$ERL_TOP/bootstrap/bin:$PATH
</code></pre><p>
That should make it possible to rebuild any library without hassle...
</p><p>
If you want to copy a library (an application) newly built, to a
release area, you do like with the emulator:
</p><pre><code class="">
$ cd $ERL_TOP/lib/stdlib
$ make TESTROOT=/tmp/erlang_release release
</code></pre><p>
Remember that:
</p><ul><li> <p>Windows specific C-code goes in the <strong>$ERL_TOP/erts/emulator/sys/win32</strong>,
<strong>$ERL_TOP/erts/emulator/drivers/win32</strong> or <strong>$ERL_TOP/erts/etc/win32</strong>.
</p> </li><li> <p>Windows specific erlang code should be used conditionally and the
host OS tested in <em>runtime</em>, the exactly same beam files should be
distributed for every platform! So write code like:
</p> <pre><code class="">
case os:type() of
    {win32,_} -&gt;
        do_windows_specific();
    Other -&gt;
        do_fallback_or_exit()
end,
</code></pre> </li></ul><p>
That's basically all you need to get going.
</p><a name="Using-GIT"></a><h3>Using GIT</h3><p>
You might want to check out versions of the source code from GitHUB. That is possible directly in Cygwin, but not in MSYS. There is a project MsysGIT:
</p><p>
URL:<a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/">http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/</a>
</p><p>
that makes a nice Git port. The msys prompt you get from MsysGIT is
however not compatible with the full version from MinGW, so you will
need to check out files using MsysGIT's command prompt and then switch
to a common MSYS command prompt for building. Also all test suites
cannot be built as MsysGIT/MSYS does not handle symbolic links. 
</p><a name="Introduction"></a><h3>Introduction</h3><p>
This document describes the process of patching an existing OTP
installation with one or more Erlang/OTP applications of newer versions
than already installed. The tool <strong>otp_patch_apply</strong> is available for this
specific purpose. It resides in the top directory of the Erlang/OTP
source tree.
</p><p>
The <strong>otp_patch_apply</strong> tool utilizes the <a href="../kernel/app#runtime_dependencies">runtime_dependencies</a> tag in
the <a href="./app">application resource file</a>. This information is used to determine
if the patch can be installed in the given Erlang/OTP installation
directory.
</p><p>
Read more about the <a href="../system_principles/versions">version handling</a> introduced in Erlang/OTP release
17, which also describes how to determine if an installation includes one
or more patched applications.
</p><p>
If you want to apply patches of multiple OTP applications that resides
in different OTP versions, you have to apply these patches in multiple
steps. It is only possible to apply multiple OTP applications from the
same OTP version at once.
</p><a name="Prerequisites"></a><h3>Prerequisites</h3><p>
It's assumed that the reader is familiar with
<a href="INSTALL">building and installing Erlang/OTP</a>. To be able to patch an
application, the following must exist:
</p><ul><li> <p>An Erlang/OTP installation.
</p> </li><li> <p>An Erlang/OTP source tree containing the updated applications that
you want to patch into the existing Erlang/OTP installation.
</p> </li></ul><a name="Using-otppatchapply"></a><h3>Using otp_patch_apply</h3><div class="alert alert-warning"><h4 class="alert-heading">Warning</h4><p>
Patching applications is a one-way process.
Create a backup of your OTP installation directory before
proceeding.
</p></div><p>
First of all, build the OTP source tree at <strong>$ERL_TOP</strong> containing
the updated applications.
</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>
Before applying a patch you need to do a <em>full</em> build
of OTP in the source directory.
</p></div><p>
If you are building in <strong>git</strong> you first need to generate the
<strong>configure</strong> scripts:
</p><pre><code class="">
$ ./otp_build autoconf
</code></pre><p>
Configure and build all applications in OTP:
</p><pre><code class="">
$ configure
$ make
</code></pre><p>
or
</p><pre><code class="">
$ ./otp_build configure
$ ./otp_build boot -a
</code></pre><p>
If you have installed documentation in the OTP installation, also
build the documentation:
</p><pre><code class="">
$ make docs
</code></pre><p>
After the successful build it's time to patch. The source tree directory,
the directory of the installation and the applications to patch are given
as arguments to <strong>otp_patch_apply</strong>. The dependencies of each application
are validated against the applications in the installation and the other
applications given as arguments. If a dependency error is detected, the
script will be aborted.
</p><p>
The <strong>otp_patch_apply</strong> syntax:
</p><pre><code class="">
$ otp_patch_apply -s &lt;Dir&gt; -i &lt;Dir&gt; [-l &lt;Dir&gt;] [-c] [-f] [-h] \
      [-n] [-v] &lt;App1&gt; [... &lt;AppN&gt;]

-s &lt;Dir&gt;  -- OTP source directory that contains build results.
-i &lt;Dir&gt;  -- OTP installation directory to patch.
-l &lt;Dir&gt;  -- Alternative OTP source library directory path(s)
             containing build results of OTP applications.
             Multiple paths should be colon separated.
-c        -- Cleanup (remove) old versions of applications
             patched in the installation.
-f        -- Force patch of application(s) even though
             dependencies are not fulfilled (should only be
             considered in a test environment).
-h        -- Print help then exit.
-n        -- Do not install documentation.
-v        -- Print version then exit.
&lt;AppX&gt;    -- Application to patch.

Environment Variable:
  ERL_LIBS  -- Alternative OTP source library directory path(s)
               containing build results of OTP applications.
               Multiple paths should be colon separated.
</code></pre><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>
The complete build environment is required while running
<strong>otp_patch_apply</strong>.
</p></div><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>
All source directories identified by <strong>-s</strong> and <strong>-l</strong> should
contain build results of OTP applications.
</p></div><p>
For example, if the user wants to install patched versions of <strong>mnesia</strong>
and <strong>ssl</strong> built in <strong>/home/me/git/otp</strong> into the OTP installation
located in <strong>/opt/erlang/my_otp</strong> type
</p><pre><code class="">
$ otp_patch_apply -s /home/me/git/otp -i /opt/erlang/my_otp \
  mnesia ssl
</code></pre><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>
If the list of applications contains core applications,
i.e <strong>erts</strong>, <strong>kernel</strong>, <strong>stdlib</strong> or <strong>sasl</strong>, the <strong>Install</strong> script in
the patched Erlang/OTP installation must be rerun.
</p></div><p>
The patched applications are appended to the list of installed
applications. Take a look at
<strong>&lt;InstallDir&gt;/releases/OTP-REL/installed_application_versions</strong>.
</p><a name="Sanity-check"></a><h3>Sanity check</h3><p>
The application dependencies can be checked using the Erlang shell.
Application dependencies are verified among installed applications by
<strong>otp_patch_apply</strong>, but these are not necessarily those actually loaded.
By calling <strong>system_information:sanity_check()</strong> one can validate
dependencies among applications actually loaded.
</p><pre><code class="">
1&gt; system_information:sanity_check().
    ok
