<strong>receive</strong> clauses are optimized by the compiler. With a few
exceptions, there is nothing to gain by rearranging clauses.</p><p>One exception is pattern matching of binaries. The compiler
does not rearrange clauses that match binaries. Placing the
clause that matches against the empty binary <em>last</em> is usually
slightly faster than placing it <em>first</em>.</p><p>The following is a rather unnatural example to show another
exception:</p><p><em>DO NOT</em></p><pre><code class="erl">
atom_map1(one) -&gt; 1;
atom_map1(two) -&gt; 2;
atom_map1(three) -&gt; 3;
atom_map1(Int) when is_integer(Int) -&gt; Int;
atom_map1(four) -&gt; 4;
atom_map1(five) -&gt; 5;
atom_map1(six) -&gt; 6.</code></pre><p>The problem is the clause with the variable <strong>Int</strong>.
As a variable can match anything, including the atoms
<strong>four</strong>, <strong>five</strong>, and <strong>six</strong>, which the following clauses
also match, the compiler must generate suboptimal code that
executes as follows:</p><ul><li>First, the input value is compared to <strong>one</strong>, <strong>two</strong>, and <strong>three</strong> (using a single instruction that does a binary search; thus, quite efficient even if there are many values) to select which one of the first three clauses to execute (if any).</li><li>If none of the first three clauses match, the fourth clause match as a variable always matches.</li><li>If the guard test <strong>is_integer(Int)</strong> succeeds, the fourth clause is executed.</li><li>If the guard test fails, the input value is compared to <strong>four</strong>, <strong>five</strong>, and <strong>six</strong>, and the appropriate clause is selected. (There is a <strong>function_clause</strong> exception if none of the values matched.)</li></ul><p>Rewriting to either:</p><p><em>DO</em></p><pre><code class="erl">
atom_map2(one) -&gt; 1;
atom_map2(two) -&gt; 2;
atom_map2(three) -&gt; 3;
atom_map2(four) -&gt; 4;
atom_map2(five) -&gt; 5;
atom_map2(six) -&gt; 6;
atom_map2(Int) when is_integer(Int) -&gt; Int.</code></pre><p>or:</p><p><em>DO</em></p><pre><code class="erl">
atom_map3(Int) when is_integer(Int) -&gt; Int;
atom_map3(one) -&gt; 1;
atom_map3(two) -&gt; 2;
atom_map3(three) -&gt; 3;
atom_map3(four) -&gt; 4;
atom_map3(five) -&gt; 5;
atom_map3(six) -&gt; 6.</code></pre><p>gives slightly more efficient matching code.</p><p>Another example:</p><p><em>DO NOT</em></p><pre><code class="erl">
map_pairs1(_Map, [], Ys) -&gt;
    Ys;
map_pairs1(_Map, Xs, [] ) -&gt;
    Xs;
map_pairs1(Map, [X|Xs], [Y|Ys]) -&gt;
    [Map(X, Y)|map_pairs1(Map, Xs, Ys)].</code></pre><p>The first argument is <em>not</em> a problem. It is variable, but it
is a variable in all clauses. The problem is the variable in the second
argument, <strong>Xs</strong>, in the middle clause. Because the variable can
match anything, the compiler is not allowed to rearrange the clauses,
but must generate code that matches them in the order written.</p><p>If the function is rewritten as follows, the compiler is free to
rearrange the clauses:</p><p><em>DO</em></p><pre><code class="erl">
map_pairs2(_Map, [], Ys) -&gt;
    Ys;
map_pairs2(_Map, [_|_]=Xs, [] ) -&gt;
    Xs;
map_pairs2(Map, [X|Xs], [Y|Ys]) -&gt;
    [Map(X, Y)|map_pairs2(Map, Xs, Ys)].</code></pre><p>The compiler will generate code similar to this:</p><p><em>DO NOT (already done by the compiler)</em></p><pre><code class="erl">
explicit_map_pairs(Map, Xs0, Ys0) -&gt;
    case Xs0 of
	[X|Xs] -&gt;
	    case Ys0 of
		[Y|Ys] -&gt;
		    [Map(X, Y)|explicit_map_pairs(Map, Xs, Ys)];
		[] -&gt;
		    Xs0
	    end;
	[] -&gt;
	    Ys0
    end.</code></pre><p>This is slightly faster for probably the most common case
that the input lists are not empty or very short.
(Another advantage is that Dialyzer can deduce a better type
for the <strong>Xs</strong> variable.)</p><h2>Function Calls</h2><p>This is an intentionally rough guide to the relative costs of
different calls. It is based on benchmark figures run on
Solaris/Sparc:</p><ul><li>Calls to local or external functions (<strong>foo()</strong>, <strong>m:foo()</strong>) are the fastest calls.</li><li>Calling or applying a fun (<strong>Fun()</strong>, <strong>apply(Fun, [])</strong>) is about <em>three times</em> as expensive as calling a local function.</li><li>Applying an exported function (<strong>Mod:Name()</strong>, <strong>apply(Mod, Name, [])</strong>) is about twice as expensive as calling a fun or about <em>six times</em> as expensive as calling a local function.</li></ul><h2>Notes and Implementation Details</h2><p>Calling and applying a fun does not involve any hash-table lookup.
A fun contains an (indirect) pointer to the function that implements
the fun.</p><p><strong>apply/3</strong> must look up the code for the function to execute
in a hash table. It is therefore always slower than a
direct call or a fun call.</p><p>It no longer matters (from a performance point of view)
whether you write:</p><pre><code class="erl">
Module:Function(Arg1, Arg2)</code></pre><p>or:</p><pre><code class="erl">
apply(Module, Function, [Arg1,Arg2])</code></pre><p>The compiler internally rewrites the latter code into the
former.</p><p>The following code is slightly slower because the shape of the
list of arguments is unknown at compile time.</p><pre><code class="erl">
apply(Module, Function, Arguments)</code></pre><h2>Memory Usage in Recursion</h2><p>When writing recursive functions, it is preferable to make them
tail-recursive so that they can execute in constant memory space:</p><p><em>DO</em></p><pre><code class="">
list_length(List) -&gt;
    list_length(List, 0).

list_length([], AccLen) -&gt; 
    AccLen; % Base case

list_length([_|Tail], AccLen) -&gt;
    list_length(Tail, AccLen + 1). % Tail-recursive</code></pre><p><em>DO NOT</em></p><pre><code class="">
list_length([]) -&gt;
    0. % Base case
list_length([_ | Tail]) -&gt;
    list_length(Tail) + 1. % Not tail-recursive</code></pre></body></html>
