(D.E. Knuth)</p><p>Efficient code can be well-structured and clean, based
on a sound overall architecture and sound algorithms.
Efficient code can be highly implementation-code that bypasses
documented interfaces and takes advantage of obscure quirks in
the current implementation.</p><p>Ideally, your code only contains the first type of efficient
code. If that turns out to be too slow, profile the application
to find out where the performance bottlenecks are and optimize only the
bottlenecks. Let other code stay as clean as possible.</p><p>This Efficiency Guide cannot really teach you how to write efficient
code. It can give you a few pointers about what to avoid and what to use,
and some understanding of how certain language features are implemented.
This guide does not include general tips about optimization that
works in any language, such as moving common calculations out of loops.</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>It is assumed that you are familiar with the Erlang programming
language and the OTP concepts.</p></body></html>
