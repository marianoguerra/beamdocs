exchange, between Erlang and other programming languages. The
included examples mainly treat interoperability between Erlang and
C.</p><h2>Purpose</h2><p>The purpose of this tutorial is to describe different
interoperability mechanisms that can be used when integrating a
program written in Erlang with a program written in another
programming language, from the Erlang programmer's
perspective.</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>It is assumed that you are a skilled Erlang programmer,
familiar with concepts such as Erlang data types, processes,
messages, and error handling.</p><p>To illustrate the interoperability principles, C programs
running in a UNIX environment have been used. It is assumed that
you have enough knowledge to apply these principles to the
relevant programming languages and platforms.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4><p>For readability, the example code is kept as simple as
possible. For example, it does not include error handling,
which might be vital in a real-life system.</p></div></body></html>
