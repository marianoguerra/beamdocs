a piece of code, solving a complex problem, in your Erlang
program. Suppose for example, that you have the following C
functions that you would like to call from Erlang:</p><pre><code class="">

/* complex.c */

int foo(int x) {
  return x+1;
}

int bar(int y) {
  return y*2;
}
</code></pre><p>The functions are deliberately kept as simple as possible, for
readability reasons.</p><p>From an Erlang perspective, it is preferable to be able to call
<strong>foo</strong> and <strong>bar</strong> without having to bother about that
they are C functions:</p><pre>
% Erlang code
...
Res = complex:foo(X),
...</pre><p>Here, the communication with C is hidden in the implementation
of <strong>complex.erl</strong>.
In the following sections, it is shown how this module can be
implemented using the different interoperability mechanisms.</p></body></html>
