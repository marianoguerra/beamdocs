Erlang programming language. </p><h2>Purpose</h2><p>The focus of the Erlang reference manual is on the language itself,
not the implementation of it. The language constructs are described in
text and with examples rather than formally specified. This is
to make the manual more readable.
The Erlang reference manual is not intended as a tutorial.</p><p>Information about implementation of Erlang can, for example, be found,
in the following:</p><ul><li><p><a href="./system_principles"> System Principles</a></p> <p>Starting and stopping, boot scripts, code loading,
<a href="./error_logging"> logging</a>,
<a href="./create_target"> creating target systems</a></p> </li><li><p><a href="./advanced"> Efficiency Guide</a></p> <p>Memory consumption, system limits</p> </li><li><p>ERTS User's Guide</p> <p><a href="./crash_dump">Crash dumps</a>,
<a href="./driver">drivers</a></p> </li></ul><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>It is assumed that the reader has done some programming and
is familiar with concepts such as data types and programming
language syntax.</p><h2>Document Conventions</h2><p>In this section, the following terminology is used:</p><ul><li>A <em>sequence</em> is one or more items. For example, a clause body consists of a sequence of expressions. This means that there must be at least one expression.</li><li>A <em>list</em> is any number of items. For example, an argument list can consist of zero, one, or more arguments.</li></ul><p>If a feature has been added in R13A or later,
this is mentioned in the text.</p><h2>Complete List of BIFs</h2><p>For a complete list of BIFs, their arguments and return values,
see <a href="./erlang">erlang(3)</a>
manual page in ERTS.</p><h2>Reserved Words</h2><p>The following are reserved words in Erlang:</p><p><strong>after and andalso band begin bnot bor bsl bsr bxor case catch cond div end fun if let not of or orelse receive rem try when xor</strong></p></body></html>
