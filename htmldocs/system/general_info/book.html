It
was introduced as of OTP 22, and have not yet been updated with all old
deprecations. Deprecations made in other parts of the documentation are of
course still valid. For more information regarding the strategy regarding
deprecations see the documentation of
<a href="./../system_principles/misc#deprecation">Support, Compatibility, Deprecations, and Removal</a>.</p><a name="OTP-22"></a><h4>OTP 22</h4><h4>VxWorks Support</h4><p>Some parts of OTP has had limited VxWorks support, such as for
example <a href="./index">erl_interface/index</a>.
This support is now deprecated and has also been
<a href="./scheduled_for_removal#OTP-23">scheduled for removal</a>.</p><h4>Legacy parts of erl_interface</h4><p>The old legacy <a href="./index">erl_interface/index</a>
library (functions with prefix <strong>erl_</strong>) is deprecated as of OTP 22. These
parts of <strong>erl_interface</strong> has been informally deprecated
for a very long time. You typically want to replace the usage of
the <strong>erl_interface</strong> library with the use of the <strong>ei</strong> library
which also is part of the <strong>erl_interface</strong> application. The old legacy
<a href="./index">erl_interface/index</a>
library has also been <a href="./scheduled_for_removal#OTP-23">scheduled for removal</a>.</p><h4>System Events</h4><p>
The format of "System Events" as defined in the man page for
<a href="./sys">sys</a>
has been clarified and cleaned up.
Due to this, code that relied on the internal badly
documented previous (before this change) format
of OTP's "System Events", needs to be changed.
</p><p>
In the wake of this the function
<a href="../stdlib/sys#get_debug/3">sys:get_debug/3</a>
that returns data with undocumented and internal format
(and therefore is practically useless) has been deprecated,
and a new function
<a href="../stdlib/sys#get_log/1">sys:get_log/1</a>
has been added,
that hopefully does what the deprecated function was intended for.
</p><a name="OTP-18"></a><h4>OTP 18</h4><h4>erlang:now()</h4><p>New time functionality and a new time API was introduced. For more information
see the <a href="./time_correction">Time and Time Correction</a>
chapter in the ERTS User's guide and specifically the
