formats, digital signatures, and <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt"> X-509 certificates</a>. It is a library application that
provides encode/decode, sign/verify, encrypt/decrypt, and similar
functionality. It does not read or write files, it expects or returns
file contents or partial file contents as binaries.
</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the Erlang programming 
language and has a basic understanding of the concepts of using public-keys 
and digital certificates.</p><h2>Performance Tips</h2><p>The Public Key decode- and encode-functions try to use the NIFs
in the ASN.1 compilers runtime modules, if they can be found.
Thus, to have the ASN1 application in the
path of your system gives the best performance.</p></body></html>
