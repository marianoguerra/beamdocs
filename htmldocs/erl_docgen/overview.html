is corresponding HTML. Documentation for an Erlang/OTP application
is usually organized as follows:</p><dl><dt><em>User's Guide</em></dt><dd> <p>(DTD:
<a href="./user_guide_dtds#partDTD">part</a>)
A collection of chapters
(<a href="./user_guide_dtds#chapterDTD">chapter</a>).
</p> </dd><dt><em>Reference Manual</em></dt><dd> <p>(DTD:
<a href="./refman_dtds#applicationDTD">application</a>
A collection of manual pages for modules
(<a href="./refman_dtds#erlrefDTD">erlref</a>),
applications
(<a href="./refman_dtds#apprefDTD">appref</a>),
commands
(<a href="./refman_dtds#comrefDTD">comref</a>),
C libraries
(<a href="./refman_dtds#crefDTD">cref</a>) and
files
(<a href="./refman_dtds#filerefDTD">fileref</a>).
</p> </dd><dt><em>Release Notes</em></dt><dd> <p>Same structure as the User's Guide.</p> </dd></dl><p>In some cases, one or more of the User's Guide, Reference Manual
and Release Notes are omitted. Also, it is possible to use either
the <strong>application</strong> or <strong>part</strong> DTD to write other types
of documentation for the application.</p><p>The structure of the different documents and the meaning of the 
tags are explained. There are numerous examples of documentation 
source code.</p><p>For readability and simplicity, the examples have been kept as
short as possible. For an example of what the generated HTML
will look like, it is recommended to look at the documentation of 
an OTP application.</p><h2>Basic Tags</h2><p>All DTDs in the OTP DTD suite share a basic set of tags.
An author can easily switch from one DTD to another and still use
the same basic tags. It is furthermore easy to copy pieces of
information from one document to another, even though they do not
use the same DTD.</p><p>The basic set of tags are divided into two categories:
<a href="block_tags">block tags</a> and
<a href="inline_tags">inline tags</a>. Block tags
typically define a separate block of information, like a
paragraph or a list. Inline tags are typically used within block
tags, for example a highlighted word within a paragraph.</p></body></html>
