This module uses a  
strict-style context passing implementation of John Hughes algorithm,  
described in "The design of a Pretty-printing Library". The  
paragraph-style formatting, empty documents, floating documents, and  
null strings are my own additions to the algorithm.To get started, you should read about the <a href="#type-document">document()</a> data
type; the main constructor functions: <a href="#text-1">text/1</a>, <a href="#above-2">above/2</a>, <a href="#beside-2">beside/2</a>, <a href="#nest-2">nest/2</a>, <a href="#sep-1">sep/1</a>, and <a href="#par-2">par/2</a>; and the main layout function <a href="#format-3">format/3</a>.If you simply want to format a paragraph of plain text, you probably
want to use the <a href="#text_par-2">text_par/2</a> function, as in the following
example:
<pre>  prettypr:format(prettypr:text_par("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"), 20)</pre></p><h2>DATA TYPES</h2><a name="types"></a><dl><dt><a name="type-document"></a>document()</dt><dd> <p>An abstract character-based "document" representing  
a number of possible layouts, which can be processed to produce a  
single concrete layout. A concrete layout can then be rendered as a  
sequence of characters containing linebreaks, which can be passed to  
a printer or terminal that uses a fixed-width font.</p> <p>For example, a document <strong>sep([text("foo"), text("bar")])</strong>
represents the two layouts
</p><pre>     foo bar</pre><p>
and
</p><pre>     foo
     bar</pre> <p>Which layout is chosen depends on the available horizontal space.
When processing a document, the main parameters are the <em>paper width</em> and the <em>line width</em> (also known as the "ribbon  
width"). In the resulting layout, no text should be printed beyond  
the paper width (which by default is 80 characters) as long as it can  
be avoided, and each single line of text (its indentation not  
counted, hence "ribbon") should preferably be no wider than the  
specified line width (which by default is 65).</p> <p>Documents can be joined into a single new document using the
constructor functions of this module. Note that the new document
often represents a larger number of possible layouts than just the
sum of the components.</p> </dd></dl><h1>Functions</h1><h2>above(D1::, D2::) -&gt;</h2><p>Concatenates documents vertically.</p><a name="above-2"></a><p>Concatenates documents vertically. Returns a document
representing the concatenation of the documents <strong>D1</strong> and <strong>D2</strong> such
that the first line of <strong>D2</strong> follows directly below the last line of
<strong>D1</strong>, and the first character of <strong>D2</strong> is in the same horizontal
column as the first character of <strong>D1</strong>, in all possible layouts.</p><p>Examples:
</p><pre>     ab  cd  =&gt;  ab
                 cd
 
                    abc
     abc   fgh  =&gt;   de
      de    ij      fgh
                     ij</pre><h2>beside(D1::, D2::) -&gt;</h2><p>Concatenates documents horizontally.</p><a name="beside-2"></a><p>Concatenates documents horizontally. Returns a document
representing the concatenation of the documents <strong>D1</strong> and <strong>D2</strong> such
that the last character of <strong>D1</strong> is horizontally adjacent to the first
character of <strong>D2</strong>, in all possible layouts. (Note: any indentation of
<strong>D2</strong> is lost.)</p><p>Examples:
</p><pre>     ab  cd  =&gt;  abcd
 
     ab  ef      ab
     cd  gh  =&gt;  cdef
                   gh</pre><h2>best(D::, PaperWidth::integer(), LineWidth::integer()) -&gt; empty |</h2><p>Selects a "best" layout for a document, creating a corresponding fixed-layout document.</p><a name="best-3"></a><p>Selects a "best" layout for a document, creating a corresponding
fixed-layout document. If no layout could be produced, the atom
<strong>empty</strong> is returned instead. For details about <strong>PaperWidth</strong> and
<strong>LineWidth</strong>, see <a href="#format-3">format/3</a>. The function is idempotent.</p><p>One possible use of this function is to compute a fixed layout for a
document, which can then be included as part of a larger document.
For example:
</p><pre>     above(text("Example:"), nest(8, best(D, W - 12, L - 6)))</pre><p>
will format <strong>D</strong> as a displayed-text example indented by 8, whose
right margin is indented by 4 relative to the paper width <strong>W</strong> of the
surrounding document, and whose maximum individual line length is
shorter by 6 than the line length <strong>L</strong> of the surrounding document.</p><p>This function is used by the <a href="#format-3">format/3</a> function to prepare a
document before being laid out as text.</p><h2>break(D::) -&gt;</h2><p>Forces a line break at the end of the given document.</p><a name="break-1"></a><p>Forces a line break at the end of the given document. This is a
utility function; see <a href="#empty-0">empty/0</a> for details.</p><h2>empty() -&gt;</h2><p>Yields the empty document, which has neither height nor width.</p><a name="empty-0"></a><p>Yields the empty document, which has neither height nor width.
(<strong>empty</strong> is thus different from an empty <a href="#text-1">text</a>  
string, which has zero width but height 1.)</p><p>Empty documents are occasionally useful; in particular, they have the
property that <strong>above(X, empty())</strong> will force a new line after <strong>X</strong>
without leaving an empty line below it; since this is a common idiom,
the utility function <a href="#break-1">break/1</a> will place a given document in
such a context.

The result represents the same
set of layouts as <strong>D</strong>; however, a floating document may be moved
relative to other floating documents immediately beside or above it,
according to their relative horizontal and vertical priorities. These
priorities are set with the <strong>Hp</strong> and <strong>Vp</strong> parameters; if omitted,  
both default to zero.</p><p>Notes: Floating documents appear to work well, but are currently less
general than you might wish, losing effect when embedded in certain
contexts. It is possible to nest floating-operators (even with
different priorities), but the effects may be difficult to predict.
In any case, note that the way the algorithm reorders floating
documents amounts to a "bubblesort", so don't expect it to be able to
sort large sequences of floating documents quickly.</p><h2>follow(D1::, D2::) -&gt;</h2><p>Equivalent to follow(D1, D2, 0). </p><a name="follow-2"></a><p>Equivalent to <a href="#follow-3">follow(D1, D2, 0)</a>.</p><h2>follow(D1::, D2::, Offset::integer()) -&gt;</h2><p>Separates two documents by either a single space, or a line break and intentation.</p><a name="follow-3"></a><p>Separates two documents by either a single space, or a line
break and intentation. In other words, one of the layouts
</p><pre>     abc def</pre><p>
or
</p><pre>     abc
      def</pre><p>  
will be generated, using the optional offset in the latter case. This  
is often useful for typesetting programming language constructs.</p><p>This is a utility function; see <a href="#par-2">par/2</a> for further details.
</p><p><em>See also:</em> <a href="#follow-2">follow/2</a>.</p><h2>format(D::) -&gt; string()</h2><p>Equivalent to format(D, 80). </p><a name="format-1"></a><p>Equivalent to <a href="#format-2">format(D, 80)</a>.</p><h2>format(D::, PaperWidth::integer()) -&gt; string()</h2><p>Equivalent to format(D, PaperWidth, 65). </p><a name="format-2"></a><p>Equivalent to <a href="#format-3">format(D, PaperWidth, 65)</a>.</p><h2>format(D::, PaperWidth::integer(), LineWidth::integer()) -&gt; string()</h2><p>Computes a layout for a document and returns the corresponding text.</p><a name="format-3"></a><p>Computes a layout for a document and returns the corresponding
text. See <a href="#type-document">document()</a> for further information. Throws
<strong>no_layout</strong> if no layout could be selected.</p><p><strong>PaperWidth</strong> specifies the total width (in character positions) of
the field for which the text is to be laid out. <strong>LineWidth</strong> specifies
the desired maximum width (in number of characters) of the text
printed on any single line, disregarding leading and trailing white
space. These parameters need to be properly balanced in order to
produce good layouts. By default, <strong>PaperWidth</strong> is 80 and <strong>LineWidth</strong>
is 65.
</p><p><em>See also:</em> <a href="#best-3">best/3</a>.</p><h2>nest(N::integer(), D::) -&gt;</h2><p>Indents a document a number of character positions to the right.</p><a name="nest-2"></a><p>Indents a document a number of character positions to the right.
Note that <strong>N</strong> may be negative, shifting the text to the left, or
zero, in which case <strong>D</strong> is returned unchanged.</p><h2>null_text(Characters::string()) -&gt;</h2><p>Similar to text/1, but the result is treated as having   zero width.</p><a name="null_text-1"></a><p>Similar to <a href="#text-1">text/1</a>, but the result is treated as having  
zero width. This is regardless of the actual length of the string.  
Null text is typically used for markup, which is supposed to have no  
effect on the actual layout.</p><p>The standard example is when formatting source code as HTML to be
placed within <strong>&lt;pre&gt;...&lt;/pre&gt;</strong> markup, and using e.g. <strong>&lt;i&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;b&gt;</strong>
to make parts of the source code stand out. In this case, the markup
does not add to the width of the text when viewed in an HTML browser,
so the layout engine should simply pretend that the markup has zero
width.

Returns a
document representing all possible left-aligned paragraph-like
layouts of the (nonempty) sequence <strong>Docs</strong> of documents. Elements in
<strong>Docs</strong> are separated horizontally by a single space character and
vertically with a single line break. All lines following the first
(if any) are indented to the same left column, whose indentation is
specified by the optional <strong>Offset</strong> parameter relative to the position
of the first element in <strong>Docs</strong>. For example, with an offset of -4,  
the following layout can be produced, for a list of documents  
representing the numbers 0 to 15:</p><pre>         0 1 2 3
     4 5 6 7 8 9
     10 11 12 13
     14 15</pre><p>
or with an offset of +2:
</p><pre>     0 1 2 3 4 5 6
       7 8 9 10 11
       12 13 14 15</pre><p>The utility function <a href="#text_par-2">text_par/2</a> can be used to easily
transform a string of text into a <strong>par</strong> representation by splitting  
it into words.</p><p>Note that whenever a document in <strong>Docs</strong> contains a line break, it
will be placed on a separate line. Thus, neither a layout such as
</p><pre>     ab cd
        ef</pre><p>
nor
</p><pre>     ab
     cd ef</pre><p>
will be generated. However, a useful idiom for making the former
variant possible (when wanted) is <strong>beside(par([D1, text("")], N), D2)</strong> for two documents <strong>D1</strong> and <strong>D2</strong>. This will break the line
between <strong>D1</strong> and <strong>D2</strong> if <strong>D1</strong> contains a line break (or if otherwise
necessary), and optionally further indent <strong>D2</strong> by <strong>N</strong> character
positions. The utility function <a href="#follow-3">follow/3</a> creates this context
for two documents <strong>D1</strong> and <strong>D2</strong>, and an optional integer <strong>N</strong>.
</p><p><em>See also:</em> <a href="#par-1">par/1</a>, <a href="#text_par-2">text_par/2</a>.</p><h2>sep(Docs::[]) -&gt;</h2><p>Arranges documents horizontally or vertically, separated by whitespace.</p><a name="sep-1"></a><p>Arranges documents horizontally or vertically, separated by
whitespace. Returns a document representing two alternative layouts
of the (nonempty) sequence <strong>Docs</strong> of documents, such that either all
elements in <strong>Docs</strong> are concatenated horizontally, and separated by a  
space character, or all elements are concatenated vertically (without  
extra separation).</p><p>Note: If some document in <strong>Docs</strong> contains a line break, the vertical  
layout will always be selected.</p><p>Examples:
</p><pre>                                  ab
     ab  cd  ef  =&gt;  ab cd ef  |  cd
                                  ef
 
     ab           ab
     cd  ef  =&gt;   cd
                  ef</pre><p>
</p><p><em>See also:</em> <a href="#par-2">par/2</a>.</p><h2>text(Characters::string()) -&gt;</h2><p>Yields a document representing a fixed, unbreakable sequence of characters.</p><a name="text-1"></a><p>Yields a document representing a fixed, unbreakable sequence of
characters. The string should contain only <em>printable</em>
characters (tabs allowed but not recommended), and <em>not</em>
newline, line feed, vertical tab, etc. A tab character (<strong>\t</strong>) is
interpreted as padding of 1-8 space characters to the next column of
8 characters <em>within the string</em>.
</p><p><em>See also:</em> <a href="#empty-0">empty/0</a>, <a href="#null_text-1">null_text/1</a>, <a href="#text_par-2">text_par/2</a>.</p><h2>text_par(Text::string()) -&gt;</h2><p>Equivalent to text_par(Text, 0). </p><a name="text_par-1"></a><p>Equivalent to <a href="#text_par-2">text_par(Text, 0)</a>.</p><h2>text_par(Text::string(), Indentation::integer()) -&gt;</h2><p>Yields a document representing paragraph-formatted plain text.</p><a name="text_par-2"></a><p>Yields a document representing paragraph-formatted plain text.
The optional <strong>Indentation</strong> parameter specifies the extra indentation
of the first line of the paragraph. For example, <strong>text_par("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet", N)</strong> could represent
</p><pre>     Lorem ipsum dolor
     sit amet</pre><p>
if <strong>N</strong> = 0, or
</p><pre>       Lorem ipsum
     dolor sit amet</pre><p>
if <strong>N</strong> = 2, or
</p><pre>     Lorem ipsum dolor
       sit amet</pre><p>
if <strong>N</strong> = -2.</p><p>(The sign of the indentation is thus reversed compared to the <a href="#par-2">par/2</a> function, and the behaviour varies slightly depending on the  
sign in order to match the expected layout of a paragraph of text.)</p><p>Note that this is just a utility function, which does all the work of
splitting the given string into words separated by whitespace and
setting up a <a href="#par-2">par</a> with the proper indentation,
containing a list of <a href="#text-1">text</a> elements.
