Erlang syntax trees, in a way that is compatible with the "parse
trees" of the STDLIB module <strong>erl_parse</strong>, together with
utilities for reading source files in unusual ways and
pretty-printing syntax trees. Also included is an amazing module
merger and renamer called Igor, as well as an automatic
code-cleaner.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>This package contains modules for handling abstract syntax trees (ASTs)
in Erlang, in a way that is compatible with the "abstract format" parse
trees of the stdlib module <strong>erl_parse</strong>, together with utilities for reading
source files, <a href="erl_prettypr">pretty-printing syntax trees</a>, <a href="igor">merging and renaming modules</a>, <a href="erl_tidy">cleaning up obsolete constructs</a>, and doing <a href="merl">metaprogramming</a> in Erlang.</p><p>The abstract layer (defined in <a href="erl_syntax">erl_syntax</a>) is nicely
structured and the node types are context-independent. The layer makes
it possible to transparently attach source-code comments and user
annotations to nodes of the tree. Using the abstract layer makes
applications less sensitive to changes in the <a href="./erl_parse">erl_parse(3)</a>
data structures, only requiring the <strong>erl_syntax</strong> module to be up-to-date.</p><p>The pretty printer <a href="erl_prettypr">erl_prettypr</a> is implemented on top of the
library module <a href="prettypr">prettypr</a>: this is a powerful and flexible generic
pretty printing library, which is also distributed separately.</p><p>For a short demonstration of parsing and pretty-printing, simply
compile the included module <a href="demo.erl">demo.erl</a>,
and execute <strong>demo:run()</strong> from the Erlang shell. It will compile the
remaining modules and give you further instructions.</p><p>Also try the <a href="erl_tidy">erl_tidy</a> module, as follows:
</p><pre>   erl_tidy:dir("any-erlang-source-dir", [test, old_guard_tests]).</pre><p>
(the <strong>test</strong> option assures that no files are modified).
